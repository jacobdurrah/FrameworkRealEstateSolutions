# AI Integration Deployment Status

## Current Status (Phase 1 Complete)

### ✅ Code Integration
- AI infrastructure successfully integrated into main branch
- Feature flag system implemented (0% rollout by default)
- Fallback mechanisms working correctly
- Frontend shows AI badge when enabled

### ⚠️ API Deployment
- API endpoints (`/api/ai/*`) not yet deployed to Vercel
- Returns 404 errors when accessed
- This is expected - requires Anthropic API key configuration in Vercel

### ✅ Graceful Degradation
- System correctly falls back to rule-based parsing when AI unavailable
- No errors shown to users
- Property address feature continues to work with rule-based strategies

## Next Steps for Full Deployment

1. **Configure Vercel Environment**
   ```bash
   vercel env add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Deploy API Endpoints**
   - Ensure `api/` directory is included in deployment
   - Verify serverless functions are enabled

3. **Test API Health**
   ```bash
   curl https://framework-realestate-solutions.vercel.app/api/ai/health
   ```

4. **Enable AI Features**
   - Start with 5% rollout
   - Monitor performance and errors
   - Gradually increase rollout percentage
