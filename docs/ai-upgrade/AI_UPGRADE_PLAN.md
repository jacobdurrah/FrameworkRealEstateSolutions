```

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Complex Multi-Phase Strategy
**Input**: "I have $50k. Buy 3 rentals in 3 months, then flip for 6 months, then buy more rentals."

**AI Output**:
- Phase 1: Rapid acquisition using creative financing
- Phase 2: Capital building through strategic flips
- Phase 3: Portfolio expansion with accumulated profits
- Detailed timeline with decision points
- Risk mitigation strategies

### 2. Constraint-Based Planning
**Input**: "I have $50k and want $3k/month without reinvesting any rental income."

**AI Output**:
- Calculated timeline to reach goal
- Optimal property mix
- Cash flow projections
- Alternative approaches if goal is unrealistic

### 3. Bonus Investment Strategy
**Input**: "I get a $30k bonus next month. How much can I grow it in real estate over 3 years?"

**AI Output**:
- Multiple growth scenarios
- Risk-adjusted projections
- Optimal investment timing
- Tax efficiency considerations

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Feature Flags**
   ```javascript
   const AI_FEATURES = {
     aiStrategyGeneration: false,  // Enable gradually
     aiGoalParsing: false,
     aiExplanations: false
   };
   ```

2. **Fallback System**
   - Keep rule-based system as backup
   - Graceful degradation on API failures
   - Cached responses for common queries

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - A/B testing with user groups
   - Response quality monitoring
   - User satisfaction tracking

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**
  - Strategy generation < 5 seconds
  - 99.9% uptime
  - < 1% error rate

- **Quality**
  - User satisfaction > 90%
  - Strategy success rate > 80%
  - Explanation clarity > 85%

- **Adoption**
  - 50% users try AI features in first month
  - 75% prefer AI over rule-based
  - 90% find explanations helpful

## Development Guidelines
