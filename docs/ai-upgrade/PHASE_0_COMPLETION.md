- Documented all existing functionality including:
  - Rule-based strategy generation
  - Goal parsing capabilities
  - Property matching with Zillow
  - Timeline visualization
  - Save/Load functionality
  - Technical architecture
  - Known limitations

### 3. ✅ Organized Codebase
- Created organized test structure:
  ```
  tests/
  ├── e2e/                    # Existing Playwright tests (70+ files)
  ├── unit/                   # For unit tests
  ├── integration/            # For integration tests
  ├── manual-test-pages/      # HTML test pages
  ├── standalone-scripts/     # Standalone test scripts
  ├── screenshots-archive/    # Test screenshots
  └── test-suites/           # Organized test suites
      ├── core-functionality.suite.js
      ├── property-matching.suite.js
      └── ui-responsiveness.suite.js
  ```

### 4. ✅ Created Test Suites
- **Core Functionality Suite**: Timeline operations, strategy generation, goal parsing, save/load
- **Property Matching Suite**: Zillow integration, address population, property display
- **UI Responsiveness Suite**: Mobile responsiveness, table interactions, accessibility

### 5. ✅ Set Up Presubmit Testing
- Created GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/presubmit.yml`)
- Updated `package.json` with test scripts:
  - `npm test` - Runs presubmit tests
  - `npm run test:core` - Core functionality tests
  - `npm run test:property` - Property matching tests
  - `npm run test:ui` - UI responsiveness tests
  - `npm run lint` - Code quality checks

### 6. ✅ Configured Code Quality Tools
- Created ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.json`)
- Set up pre-commit hook for automatic checks
- Created `scripts/run-presubmit-tests.sh` for local testing

### 7. ✅ Created AI Upgrade Documentation
- Comprehensive upgrade plan at `docs/ai-upgrade/AI_UPGRADE_PLAN.md`
- Detailed implementation phases
- Technical architecture
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics

## Codebase Status

### Clean Structure
- ✅ Root directory cleaned of test files
- ✅ Tests organized into logical directories
- ✅ Documentation properly structured
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### Quality Checks
- ⚠️ 33 console.log statements in production code (non-blocking)
- ⚠️ Some TODO comments remain (tracked for future)
- ✅ No test files in root directory
- ✅ Proper file organization

### Test Coverage
- 70+ end-to-end tests available
- 3 organized test suites created
- Automated presubmit checks configured
- CI/CD pipeline ready

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Run `npm test` to verify presubmit tests pass
3. Review and address any lint warnings

### Phase 1 Preparation
1. Set up Claude API access
2. Create development branch for AI features
3. Design API integration architecture
4. Create feature flags for gradual rollout

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Run all presubmit tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:core
npm run test:property
npm run test:ui

# Run linter
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix  # Auto-fix issues

# Run full test suite
npm run test:full

# Clean test artifacts
npm run clean:test
```

## Conclusion

Phase 0 has been successfully completed. The codebase is now:
- Well-documented with current feature list
- Properly organized with clear structure
- Protected by automated testing
- Ready for AI upgrade implementation

The foundation is solid for beginning the AI transformation in Phase 1.
