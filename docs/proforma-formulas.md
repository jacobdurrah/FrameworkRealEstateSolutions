## Core Financial Metrics

### Net Operating Income (NOI)
**Formula:** `NOI = Effective Gross Income - Operating Expenses`

**Example:** 
- Effective Gross Income: $15,156/year
- Operating Expenses: $6,156/year
- NOI = $15,156 - $6,156 = $9,000/year

**What it means:** NOI represents the property's annual income after all operating expenses but before debt service. It's the foundation for most other metrics.

---

### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)
**Formula:** `Cap Rate = (Annual NOI ÷ Purchase Price) × 100`

**Example:**
- Annual NOI: $9,000
- Purchase Price: $75,000
- Cap Rate = ($9,000 ÷ $75,000) × 100 = 12%

**Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: 10%+
- Good: 6-10%
- Average: 4-6%
- Poor: Below 4%

**How to use:** "A 12% cap rate means if you paid cash for the property, you'd earn 12% annually on your investment. Higher cap rates indicate better returns but may also signal higher risk."

---

### Cash on Cash Return (CoC)
**Formula:** `CoC Return = (Annual Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested) × 100`

**Example:**
- Annual Cash Flow: $4,692
- Total Cash Invested: $27,125
- CoC Return = ($4,692 ÷ $27,125) × 100 = 17.3%

**Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: 12%+
- Good: 8-12%
- Average: 5-8%
- Poor: Below 5%

**How to use:** "A 17.3% cash-on-cash return means you're earning $17.30 annually for every $100 of cash invested. This is your actual return on the cash you put into the deal."

---

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
**Formula:** `DSCR = Annual NOI ÷ Annual Debt Service`

**Example:**
- Annual NOI: $9,000
- Annual Debt Service: $6,348
- DSCR = $9,000 ÷ $6,348 = 1.42

**Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: 1.4+
- Good: 1.25-1.4
- Minimum: 1.2
- Poor: Below 1.0

**How to use:** "A 1.42 DSCR means the property generates 42% more income than needed to cover the mortgage. Lenders typically require at least 1.2-1.25 DSCR."

---

### Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)
**Formula:** `GRM = Purchase Price ÷ Annual Gross Rent`

**Example:**
- Purchase Price: $75,000
- Annual Gross Rent: $15,948
- GRM = $75,000 ÷ $15,948 = 4.7

**Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: Below 5
- Good: 5-7
- Average: 7-10
- Poor: Above 10

**How to use:** "A GRM of 4.7 means it takes 4.7 years of gross rent to equal the purchase price. Lower GRM indicates better value - this property is excellent."

---

### Return on Investment (ROI)
**Formula:** `ROI = (Total Annual Return ÷ Total Cash Invested) × 100`

Where Total Annual Return includes:
- Cash Flow
- Principal Paydown
- Appreciation
- Tax Benefits

**Example:**
- Annual Cash Flow: $4,692
- Principal Paydown: $750
- Appreciation (3%): $2,250
- Tax Benefits: $1,200
- Total Return: $8,892
- Total Cash Invested: $27,125
- ROI = ($8,892 ÷ $27,125) × 100 = 32.8%

**Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: 15%+
- Good: 10-15%
- Average: 7-10%
- Poor: Below 7%

**How to use:** "A 32.8% total ROI means you're earning nearly a third of your investment back each year when considering all returns."

---

## Income Calculations

### Gross Rental Income
**Formula:** `Gross Rental Income = Monthly Rent × 12`

### Effective Gross Income
**Formula:** `Effective Gross Income = Gross Rental Income × (1 - Vacancy Rate)`

**Example:**
- Monthly Rent: $1,329
- Annual Gross: $15,948
- Vacancy Rate: 5%
- Effective Gross Income = $15,948 × 0.95 = $15,156

---

## Expense Calculations

### Operating Expense Ratio
**Formula:** `Operating Expense Ratio = Total Operating Expenses ÷ Effective Gross Income`

**Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: Below 35%
- Good: 35-50%
- Average: 50-60%
- Poor: Above 60%

### Common Operating Expenses:
1. **Property Tax:** Typically 1-3% of property value annually
2. **Insurance:** $800-1,500 per year for single family
3. **Property Management:** 8-10% of collected rent
4. **Maintenance:** 5-10% of rent (age dependent)
5. **Reserves:** 5-10% of rent for future repairs
6. **Utilities:** Varies if landlord paid
7. **HOA Fees:** If applicable

---

## Financing Calculations

### Monthly Payment (Principal & Interest)
**Formula:** 
```
Monthly Payment = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
P = Loan Amount
r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate ÷ 12)
n = Number of Payments (Years × 12)
```

**Example:**
- Loan Amount: $56,250
- Annual Rate: 7.5%
- Term: 30 years
- Monthly Payment = $393

### Loan to Value (LTV)
**Formula:** `LTV = (Loan Amount ÷ Property Value) × 100`

### Total Cash Needed
**Formula:** `Total Cash = Down Payment + Rehab Budget + Closing Costs`

---

## Exit Strategy Calculations

### Fix & Flip Profit
**Formula:** `Flip Profit = ARV - Purchase Price - Rehab Costs - Holding Costs - Selling Costs`

**Selling Costs typically include:**
- Realtor Fees: 6%
- Closing Costs: 1-2%
- Concessions: 0-2%

### BRRRR Cash Out
**Formula:** `Cash Out = (ARV × Refinance LTV) - Original Loan Balance - Refinance Closing Costs`

**Example:**
- ARV: $120,000
- Refinance LTV: 75%
- New Loan: $90,000
- Original Loan: $56,250
- Closing Costs: $2,000
- Cash Out = $90,000 - $56,250 - $2,000 = $31,750

### Hold Period Returns (5-Year)
Includes:
1. Cumulative Cash Flow
2. Principal Paydown
3. Property Appreciation
4. Tax Benefits
