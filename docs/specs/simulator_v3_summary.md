## 💡 Example Strategies

### Conservative (Rental-Focused)

Result: $5,200/month passive income
Lower risk, steady growth
```

### Balanced (Mixed Approach)
```
Months 1-6: 2 rentals + 1 flip
Months 7-12: Use flip profit for 3 more rentals
Months 13-24: BRRR + more rentals
Result: $7,500/month passive income
```

### Aggressive (Flip-Heavy)
```
Months 1-12: 3 flips generating $100K
Months 13-24: Convert profits to rental empire
Result: $10,000/month passive income
Faster but higher risk
```
