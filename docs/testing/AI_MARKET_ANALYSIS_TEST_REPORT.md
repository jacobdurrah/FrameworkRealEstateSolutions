# AI Market Analysis Feature - Test Report

## Test Summary
Date: 2025-06-18
Status: âœ… PASSING (with minor issues)

## Feature Overview
The AI-powered Market Analysis feature allows users to:
- Toggle between pattern-based and AI-powered natural language queries
- See SQL preview with explanations before execution
- Execute complex queries using plain English

## Test Results

### âœ… Successful Tests
1. **AI Mode Toggle** - Works correctly, switches between modes
2. **Pattern Mode** - Still functional, shows results (though data seems limited)
3. **Error Handling** - Shows appropriate error messages
4. **API Integration** - Claude API successfully generates SQL

### ðŸ”§ Issues Found & Fixed
1. **Model Version** - Updated from `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
2. **SQL Formatting** - Removed trailing semicolons that caused validation errors
3. **CORS Configuration** - Updated to support both production and development

### ðŸ“Š Current Status
- **Live URL**: https://framework-c25m3kvqe-jacob-durrahs-projects.vercel.app
- **API Endpoints**: Working correctly
- **SQL Generation**: Successfully converts natural language to SQL
- **SQL Execution**: Limited by Supabase query builder (no complex JOINs)

## Example Queries That Work

### AI Mode (Natural Language)
- "What properties did Jacob buy?"
- "Show recent sales"
- "List all cash sales above $100k"
- "Who bought properties in 48214?"

### Pattern Mode
- "Top buyers"
- "Top sellers"
- "Recent sales"
- "High value sales"

## Limitations
1. **Complex SQL**: JOINs and subqueries not supported due to Supabase limitations
2. **Data**: Test results show limited data (0 properties, $0 totals)
3. **Rate Limiting**: API has rate limits for high-volume usage

## Recommendations
1. **Data Population**: Ensure the sales_transactions table has sufficient test data
2. **SQL Parser**: Consider implementing a more robust SQL-to-Supabase converter
3. **Caching**: Current 5-minute cache helps with repeated queries
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging to track usage and errors

## Test Commands
```bash
# Run AI tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/market-analysis-ai.spec.js

# Run simple tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/market-analysis-ai-simple.spec.js

# Test API directly
curl -X POST https://framework-c25m3kvqe-jacob-durrahs-projects.vercel.app/api/market/generate-sql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Show recent sales"}'
```

## Deployment
The feature is fully deployed and functional. Users can access it at:
- Market Analysis page: `/market-analysis.html`
- Toggle "AI Mode (Beta)" to enable natural language queries

## Next Steps
1. Monitor usage and gather user feedback
2. Improve SQL parsing for complex queries
3. Add more sophisticated error handling
4. Consider adding query templates for common use cases
