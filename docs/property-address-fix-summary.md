# Property Address Population Fix Summary

## Issue
Property addresses were not populating in the Timeline Events table after clicking "Find Actual Listings". The Zillow link icon would appear, but the address text fields remained blank.

## Root Cause
The `renderTimelineTable` function in `timeline-renderer-enhanced.js` was overwriting property data during re-renders, not preserving the real listing information from the ListingsMatcher.

## Solution
Created `timeline-renderer-fix.js` that:

1. **Preserves Real Listing Data**: Checks for `realListing` flag and `listingUrl` before rendering
2. **Maintains Property Format**: Ensures addresses use "Rental X: address" format
3. **Syncs Buy/Sell Events**: Updates sell events to match the property names of their corresponding buy events
4. **Adds Zillow Links**: Displays clickable Zillow icons next to properties with real listings

## Implementation Details

### Key Code Changes
```javascript
// Check if row has real listing data
const hasRealListing = row.realListing && row.listingUrl;
const hasAddress = row.property && row.property.includes(':');

// Preserve property with Zillow link
if (hasRealListing || hasAddress) {
    propertyCell = `
        <div class="property-with-link">
            <input type="text" class="editable property-input" 
                   value="${row.property || ''}" 
                   onchange="updateTimeline(${row.id}, 'property', this.value)"
                   placeholder="Property address">
            <a href="${zillowUrl}" target="_blank" class="zillow-link">
                <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>
            </a>
        </div>
    `;
}
```

### Files Modified
1. **js/timeline-renderer-fix.js** - New file with the fix
2. **portfolio-simulator-v2.html** - Added script reference
3. **portfolio-simulator-v3.html** - Added script reference

## Testing
Created comprehensive Playwright tests in `tests/e2e/property-address-population.spec.js` that verify:
- Property addresses populate after clicking "Find Actual Listings"
- Addresses use correct "Rental X: address" format
- Zillow links are present and functional
- Property fields remain editable after population
- Sell events have matching property names to buy events

## Deployment
The fix has been deployed to both v2 and v3 of the Portfolio Simulator. The timeline-renderer-fix.js loads after timeline-renderer-enhanced.js and overrides the renderTimelineTable function to preserve property data.

## Verification Steps
1. Go to Portfolio Simulator V3
2. Enter a goal (e.g., "Build $10K/month portfolio in 3 years")
3. Click "Generate Strategy"
4. Click "Apply to Timeline"
5. Click "Find Actual Listings"
6. Verify property addresses populate in "Rental X: address" format
7. Verify Zillow links appear next to properties
8. Verify sell events have matching property names
