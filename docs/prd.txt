PRD for Framework Detroit Website, AI Integration, and Assistant

Framework Detroit Real Estate – AI Integration & Website PRD
Introduction
Framework Real Estate Solutions, LLC ("Framework Detroit") is a Detroit-based real estate startup with a mission to revitalize local neighborhoods through thoughtful rehabs and community-focused investments
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance Framework Detroit’s business plan with technology initiatives, including a new company website, integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into business operations, and the development of an AI-driven personal assistant (via WhatsApp). By leveraging modern web design and AI tools, Framework Detroit aims to improve its operational efficiency, investment decision-making, marketing outreach, and overall value proposition. The outcome of these initiatives will be an updated business plan that incorporates AI-driven strategies and a clear roadmap for implementation. Objectives:
Launch an Official Website & Branding: Establish a professional web presence (frameworkdetroit.com) featuring the company’s portfolio, pipeline of projects, investor portal, and blog
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. Develop consistent branding (including business cards and logos) to support marketing and credibility.
Integrate AI into the Business: Identify and implement AI solutions across core business areas (deal sourcing, underwriting, marketing, and operations) to gain efficiency and competitive advantage. According to McKinsey, real estate companies effectively using AI have seen >10% increases in net operating income through efficiency gains, better customer experiences, and smarter asset selection
mckinsey.com
. Leveraging AI will help Framework Detroit become a tech-forward firm in a traditionally tech-slow industry
mckinsey.com
.
Develop an AI Property Analysis Assistant: Create an AI-powered personal assistant (accessible via WhatsApp) that team members can query with a property address to automatically gather data (from Zillow, city parcel records, etc.), analyze property condition from photos, and generate investment recommendations (purchase/acquisition strategy, rehab scope, pro forma financials). This tool will drastically reduce analysis time – tasks that once took days could be done in seconds with AI
wavgroup.com
 – and ensure consistent deal evaluations.
Continuously Improve & Innovate: Establish a feedback loop to refine the AI tools and website, and explore additional features (e.g. advanced analytics, predictive models, or customer-facing AI services) to maintain a competitive edge.
The sections below detail the plan for each component, including scope, requirements, architecture, cost considerations, and how it aligns with Framework Detroit’s updated business strategy.
Website Development Plan (Architecture & Cost)
Purpose & Features: The company website (proposed at frameworkdetroit.com) will be the digital hub for Framework Detroit’s brand and operations. Per the initial business plan, the site will include: a project portfolio of past and current rehabs, a pipeline section for upcoming deals, an investor contact portal for prospective investors, and a blog to share updates and insights
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. Additionally, the site should incorporate basic company information (mission, team, contact info) and potentially a login-protected area for partner or investor materials if needed. Integrating case studies of projects (before-and-after details, community impact) is key, as noted in the marketing plan
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. The website will also support lead generation (e.g. a form for investors or property sellers to get in touch) and be optimized for SEO (search engine visibility) and Google My Business listing, consistent with the branding strategy
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. Architecture & Tech Stack: For a fast and cost-effective launch, the site can be built on a Content Management System (CMS) or modern web framework:
Option 1: CMS (e.g. WordPress or Wix) – This offers quick deployment with templates, plugins for portfolios and blogs, and easy content updates. A WordPress-based real estate site with custom design typically costs in the $2,000–$10,000 range
attck.com
, with lower costs if using standard templates and higher if custom development is needed. Maintenance is straightforward, though security updates must be applied regularly.
Option 2: Custom Web Application (e.g. React/Next.js frontend + Node/Python backend) – This would allow more flexibility (e.g. a tailored investor portal, integration with internal databases), at higher initial development effort. A custom real estate website can cost $20,000+ depending on complexity
iihglobal.com
. Given our current needs (mainly content display and contact forms), a full custom build may be unnecessary; however, we might use custom elements within a CMS (like a plugin or embedded web app for the investment pipeline data).
The website architecture will likely follow a standard model:
Frontend: Responsive web pages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with a clean, modern design that reflects Detroit’s vibe and the company’s community-driven mission. Emphasize visuals (property photos, Detroit neighborhood imagery) to make the site engaging. Ensure mobile-friendly design (many users/investors will browse on phones).
Backend: If using a CMS, the backend is largely provided by the platform (e.g. WordPress PHP/MySQL environment). If custom, set up a server (cloud-hosted) with a database to store project data, user inquiries, etc. For scalability and security, a cloud hosting (like AWS, Azure, or managed WordPress hosting) is recommended. Hosting costs can range from $5–10/month for basic shared hosting up to a few hundred for robust cloud setups
attck.com
attck.com
; initially, a modest hosting plan ($20/month) should suffice, with the ability to upgrade as traffic grows.
Database: Likely needed to store content such as project details and blog posts (though a CMS handles this internally). If an investor portal with user accounts is included down the line, a secure database for user data would be required.
Integration: Include a contact form or investor portal that emails submissions to the team (or stores them in a CRM). Possibly integrate with the company’s Google Workspace for email and document hosting. Future integration could include live chat or a chatbot (e.g. an AI assistant popup for site visitors, which can be an extension of our WhatsApp assistant logic).
Security & Compliance: Use SSL for the site (HTTPS), implement basic security hardening (especially if using a CMS, to prevent common vulnerabilities), and ensure compliance with privacy laws for any user data collected (display a privacy policy and obtain consent for contact forms). Use reliable plugins/services for forms to avoid spam.
Design & Branding: The site’s design will align with Framework Detroit’s branding. A logo should be finalized and used on the site and business collateral. The color scheme might draw inspiration from Detroit’s heritage (for instance, earthy tones or the city’s flag colors) to resonate locally. We will also produce business cards and stationery with the same branding. A consistent visual identity across the website, business cards, and social media will enhance professionalism. Business Cards: Design high-quality cards featuring the logo, contact info, and tagline (“Rebuilding Detroit with Purpose.”) to use in networking and community events – while not a digital product, this is a quick win for marketing and should be part of the branding package in the website project timeline. Content Plan: Populate the site with initial content:
Portfolio: Profiles of at least 1-2 completed or in-progress projects (with photos, descriptions, investment stats, community impact notes).
Pipeline: If appropriate to share, highlight upcoming target properties or neighborhoods (could be general, e.g. “Focusing on Fitzgerald and Bagley neighborhoods
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
” without giving away exact addresses). This shows momentum but be careful not to reveal sensitive deal info publicly.
Investor Portal: Provide information for potential investors (e.g. overview of investment strategy, FAQs, a form to contact for more info or to join a mailing list). In the future, this could evolve into a login area where verified investors can see detailed deal offerings.
Blog: Kick off with posts about the company’s mission and Detroit market insights. Regular updates (e.g. monthly) with project updates, Detroit real estate trends, or community stories will keep content fresh and improve SEO.
Cost Estimates: Based on industry data, a basic to mid-range real estate website with our feature set is expected to cost roughly $2,000 to $5,000 if using a template and in-house content creation, or up to $10,000+ if engaging a professional designer/developer for a custom look
iihglobal.com
attck.com
. We should budget additionally for:
Domain & Hosting: Domain ~$15/year, hosting ~$100–$300/year for a small site (scales up if traffic increases or if we need dedicated resources)
attck.com
.
Design Assets: Logo design might be a one-time cost (could range $0 if done by founders, up to ~$500 if hiring a freelance designer). Stock images or photography for the site may incur some cost if high-quality images of Detroit or properties are needed (or we can use our own project photos).
Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance ~5-10% of initial development cost per year
iihglobal.com
 – includes keeping software updated, content updates, minor tweaks, and security monitoring. Initially, this could be minimal if the site is small (the team can handle blog updates, etc.), but as the site grows, allocating a few hundred dollars per year or some internal time for maintenance is wise.
SEO and Marketing: While much can be done in-house (blogging, social media integration), we might consider an SEO tool or hiring expertise for optimization, which could be a few hundred dollars one-time or monthly if ongoing.
Timeline: A basic site can be up within 4–6 weeks. Key milestones:
Week 1-2: Finalize site map and content outline; choose platform (CMS vs custom) and gather design inspiration.
Week 2-4: Develop the site pages and features; iterate on design; implement contact form and any necessary plugins.
Week 4-5: Populate content (text and images); set up Google My Business profile and link to site; integrate Google Analytics.
Week 5-6: Testing across devices/browsers; SEO basics (meta tags, site description); security check; launch the site.
Post-launch: Monitor and fix any issues; announce the website on social media and to the company’s network.
Launching the website (and distributing new business cards) is also one of the immediate next steps identified in the original plan
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. It will establish credibility online and serve as a foundation for rolling out the more advanced AI-driven tools.
AI Integration Strategy for Business
To modernize operations and gain an edge, Framework Detroit will incorporate AI technologies throughout its business. This section outlines how AI can be leveraged in different domains of the company:
1. AI for Deal Sourcing & Underwriting
Opportunity Identification: Use predictive analytics on real estate data to find promising investment deals faster. AI models can analyze large datasets (MLS listings, public records, demographic trends) to flag properties or neighborhoods that fit our criteria (e.g. undervalued homes in target areas with high appreciation potential). Tools like Likely.AI and SmartZip already analyze past sales, ownership tenure, and market trends to predict who is likely to sell or which properties might be good targets
luxurypresence.com
. By inputting our focus neighborhoods and property type (single-family/duplex) into similar models, we can prioritize leads more efficiently than manual search. Automated Underwriting: Instead of manually combing through comps and spreadsheets for every prospective deal, AI can assist in preliminary underwriting. For example, an AI-driven valuation model could estimate a property's after-repair value (ARV) and optimal purchase price by learning from comparable sales and considering the property’s features. Zillow’s own AI has demonstrated high accuracy in image-based home valuation, achieving <2% error rates by analyzing property photos for condition and finishes
contempothemes.com
. We can leverage open APIs or train a custom model to estimate ARVs given raw data (square footage, beds/baths, location) combined with an image-based condition assessment (more on that below). Additionally, AI can rapidly calculate key metrics (ROI, rent-to-value, etc.) and check them against our criteria (e.g. Return on Cost > 30%, Net Margin ≥ 20% as per our current deal metrics
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
) to see if a deal is worth pursuing. This speeds up the screening process, focusing human attention only on deals that pass initial automated checks. Risk Assessment: Analytical AI can help flag potential red flags that might be buried in data. For instance, it could scan city permit or code violation data to warn of properties with past structural issues, or use natural language processing (NLP) to summarize inspection reports or seller disclosures. By training on historical project outcomes, an AI might even predict which rehab projects are likely to go over-budget or long on timeline (learning from factors like property age, neighborhood, contractor used, etc.), thus informing our decision to take on a project or not. While these models require data and refinement, building them gives a future advantage in risk management.
2. AI for Renovation Planning & Project Management
Rehabilitation is a core part of Framework’s business. AI can streamline and improve this process:
Scope of Work Generation: As detailed in the AI assistant plan (next section), computer vision can analyze property photos and automatically identify renovation needs. An AI that tags images with keywords (e.g. "outdated kitchen", "water damage ceiling", "old roof") can generate a draft scope of work for a property. This technology is already emerging – for example, Revive’s Vision AI tool analyzes listing photos and “estimates renovation costs, potential market value, and projected ROI,” then outputs a recommended improvement plan
wavgroup.com
. Using a similar approach, our system can not only speed up creating a rehab plan but also ensure we don’t overlook common issues.
Cost Estimation: Building on the scope, an AI model (trained on past rehab costs or industry data) can provide a rough cost estimate for each item. This would be continuously refined as we feed it actual cost data from our projects. (E.g., it learns typical costs to replace a roof of X square feet or remodel a bathroom in Detroit.) Over time, this improves budgeting accuracy. In early stages, we could integrate a third-party construction cost API or dataset to help price out the scope automatically.
Project Scheduling: AI optimization algorithms can help create efficient project schedules, sequencing tasks for optimal workflow and even adjusting timelines if delays occur. For instance, if we have multiple projects, a scheduling AI could allocate crews optimally or predict delays (like seasonality effects on exterior work).
Monitoring Progress: Using AI with cameras or drones (a future tool we noted
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
), we could potentially monitor job sites. While drone walkthroughs themselves are planned, adding an AI that compares work-in-progress photos to the plan can flag if something is behind schedule or done incorrectly. This is an advanced use case, but it’s on the horizon (some construction tech firms use AI for site monitoring
hover.to
).
Quality Control: AI can assist in quality checks by analyzing photos of completed work for defects or deviations (for example, detecting if paint coverage is even, or if debris remains after a clean-up). Though this is experimental, it could be explored in the long term.
3. AI for Marketing & Sales
Marketing is vital for attracting buyers, tenants, and investors. Generative AI can elevate our marketing efforts:
Property Listing Descriptions: When selling a rehabbed property, AI (like GPT-4) can craft compelling listing descriptions highlighting the best features. Agents already use AI to write listings in specific tones or to emphasize details for target buyer demographics
luxurypresence.com
luxurypresence.com
. We can input our renovation highlights and let AI draft a polished narrative, saving time and ensuring every listing is enticing and professional.
Virtual Staging & Visualization: Instead of physically staging every home, we can use AI virtual staging tools to add furniture and decor to photos of empty rooms. Tools like BoxBrownie or others use AI to insert life-like furniture and make spaces more attractive to buyers
luxurypresence.com
. This is cost-effective and fast. Additionally, if we list rentals, Matterport-style AI 3D tours can provide immersive remote walkthroughs
luxurypresence.com
. These tech-forward methods can make our properties stand out online and sell or rent faster.
Social Media & Content Creation: Maintaining a social presence (Instagram @FrameworkDetroit, as planned
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
) can be augmented with AI. AI tools can generate social media captions, hashtags, and even design graphics or short promo videos. For instance, an AI could automatically create a before-and-after image slider of a rehab with a catchy caption. Consistency here builds brand awareness. We can also utilize AI to analyze posting times and audience engagement to optimize our social media strategy.
SEO & Blog Writing: For our blog and investor newsletters, AI can help research and draft articles on Detroit market trends, investment tips, etc. We can feed local data (sales stats, rental rates) to a GPT-based tool to write market reports that we then lightly edit
luxurypresence.com
luxurypresence.com
. This provides valuable content to our investors and boosts our site’s SEO with relatively little manual writing.
Customer Engagement: Chatbot AI can handle routine inquiries from potential sellers or investors via the website. For example, a chatbot could answer frequently asked questions (“What areas do you invest in?”, “How does your process work?”) or collect lead information 24/7. This improves responsiveness without needing a full-time staffer to monitor chat. Luxury Presence reports that AI-powered lead nurture tools can reply to inbound messages immediately and increase lead response rates above 50%
luxurypresence.com
, which suggests we could capture more opportunities by not missing inquiries.
Investor Relations: For existing investors, AI can personalize updates. Imagine an AI that can automatically generate a short report for each investor on their portfolio with us (if we have multiple deals or a fund), highlighting key updates. While our scale is small initially, planning such capabilities sets the stage for when we have many investors to manage.
4. AI for Operations & Efficiency
Beyond deals and marketing, AI can improve internal efficiency:
Document Management: Real estate involves a lot of paperwork (contracts, leases, insurance, etc.). An AI document assistant can quickly retrieve information or even summarize legal documents. For instance, we could use NLP to query our repository of purchase agreements or contractor contracts (“Find the clause about termination in the GC contract”) and get an instant answer rather than manually searching. GenAI tools can also extract key points from dense documents
mckinsey.com
, reducing the time we spend on administrative review.
Communication and Scheduling: We can deploy AI to manage some of our communications. One idea is an AI email assistant that drafts routine emails (like responding to inquiries or scheduling site visits) for us to review and send. Also, for team coordination, an AI assistant could parse our calendars and suggest optimal meeting times or send reminders for deadlines (like permit renewal dates, insurance payments, etc.). These are small things individually, but they add up to significant time saved.
Training and Knowledge Capture: As the team grows, an internal AI knowledge base could help onboard new members. For example, feeding it our best practices, past project reports, and procedures would allow a chatbot to answer, “How do I pull comps?” or “What’s our process for pulling permits?” This keeps institutional knowledge accessible. It’s like a smart internal FAQ that learns from our documentation.
Analytical Dashboards: AI can automate the creation of financial or operational dashboards by pulling data from various sources (bank accounts, project budgets in spreadsheets, etc.) and presenting it in a cohesive way. This could help track our KPIs (profit margins, timelines, etc.) in real time. For instance, an AI script could fetch data from QuickBooks and output a weekly summary of expenses vs budget for each project.
Why This Matters: Incorporating AI into these areas will directly support our long-term vision. It enables scaling up effectively – with AI handling repetitive or complex analytical tasks, the small team can manage more projects (goal: 20+ properties in 3-5 years
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
) without a linear increase in manpower. It also differentiates Framework Detroit as a forward-thinking company. The real estate industry has historically lagged in tech adoption
mckinsey.com
, so by embracing AI early, we gain a competitive advantage. Early adopters can capture outsized gains – generative AI alone could create $110–$180 billion in new value in real estate, according to industry analysis
mckinsey.com
. Even on a small scale, more efficient operations and data-driven decisions can mean better deals and returns. In fact, real estate firms using AI have improved net income by over 10% through efficiency and smarter asset selection
mckinsey.com
. This potential upside justifies the investment in AI capabilities as part of our business plan. Of course, implementing these AI solutions will require resources (talent, software, possibly consulting). We plan to start small and focused (see the personal assistant below as our initial flagship AI project), then gradually expand AI initiatives as we learn and as the business grows. Continuous improvement and iteration are key: we’ll monitor the results of each AI integration, gather feedback from users (team or investors), and refine the tools to better meet our objectives.
Updated Business Plan Incorporating AI
By integrating the above technology plans, Framework Detroit’s overall business plan needs to be updated to reflect new capabilities, strategies, and goals. This section highlights the major updates to the business plan after incorporating AI and AI agents: 1. Value Proposition Enhancement: Framework Detroit is no longer just a traditional real estate rehab company; it becomes a tech-augmented real estate investment firm. The mission remains community revitalization, but we add that we leverage advanced technology (AI/ML) to identify opportunities and execute projects with greater speed and precision. This tech-driven edge means we can uncover value that others miss and adapt quickly to market signals. It’s worth mentioning in our company overview that our approach combines real estate expertise and data science to “rebuild Detroit with purpose – and efficiency.” This dual identity can attract not only real estate investors but also tech-savvy partners or those excited about innovation in housing. 2. Competitive Advantage: Our business plan’s market analysis should note that few local competitors are using AI in this space, giving Framework a first-mover advantage in Detroit. We can underwrite deals faster and more thoroughly. For example, if a distressed property hits the market, our AI tools can immediately analyze it (pull comps, estimate rehab needs) and we can make an informed offer faster than competitors. This speed is a competitive advantage in acquiring properties. Also, our use of AI for marketing (like better listings and wider outreach) can lead to faster sales at higher prices, improving our turnover rate and margins. These points should be added to the SWOT analysis: under “Strengths,” include technology utilization (AI) and how it yields better decision-making; under “Opportunities,” include being a local pioneer in AI-driven real estate to attract partnerships or exclusive deal flow. 3. Operations & Team Structure: With AI tools doing much of the heavy lifting in analysis and operations, our human resources can be structured more efficiently. The business plan should incorporate a role for a Technology Lead or Data Analyst (even if part-time or outsourced) who will maintain the AI systems and ensure data quality. This could be an update to the “Team Responsibilities” section (e.g., assign someone to manage the development of the AI assistant, or to oversee data integration) since in the original plan roles were “To be assigned”
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. We might also revise our hiring plan: instead of immediately hiring more analysts or admin staff as we scale, we might invest in technical expertise or training existing members on AI tools. This keeps the team lean while scaling output. It also means we allocate budget differently – e.g., a line item for AI software/subscriptions or consulting, balanced by possibly lower personnel costs in analysis/marketing. 4. Financial Projections: Incorporating AI can affect our financial model. Initially, there will be upfront costs (development of the website and AI assistant, software subscriptions, etc.), which should be reflected as investments in the startup costs and Year 1 expenses. However, over time, the efficiency gains should improve our profitability. For instance, if AI helps us flip houses faster or avoid bad deals, our return on investment could improve. We might project slightly better margins or shorter project timelines in the pro forma. Additionally, if the AI enables us to do more projects in parallel (since analysis is not a bottleneck), revenue growth could accelerate in years 2-3. We should update the projections to show a scenario where, by year 3, we handle maybe 20% more projects than we originally thought, due to AI-enabled productivity. It’s important to be somewhat conservative and not over-promise, but highlighting this potential will look favorable to investors. We can cite industry expectations: for example, generative AI and advanced analytics could significantly boost productivity; McKinsey notes real estate operations can become more efficient and open up new revenue streams with AI
mckinsey.com
. We can incorporate a modest efficiency gain in our forecasts (say operations cost as a percentage of revenue decreases over time thanks to automation). 5. New Services or Revenue Streams: An AI-enabled Framework Detroit might develop new offerings. For example, the AI property analysis tool we build for internal use could eventually be offered as a service to other investors or to government programs (e.g. helping Detroit Land Bank evaluate properties at scale). If we see this potential, we could add a note in the long-term vision about a tech product spin-off or licensing our proprietary algorithm. Similarly, our improved marketing and analysis capabilities could allow us to partner with more investors (maybe managing an investor fund was a 3-5 year vision
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
; AI could help manage that fund’s assets more effectively, making that vision more attainable sooner). We should update the “Long-Term Vision” section to include being a leader in tech-driven community redevelopment and perhaps developing a platform that could serve others (this aligns with possibly launching an investor fund – we could manage more capital if our systems allow us to find and manage deals efficiently). 6. Risk Mitigation and Management: The business plan should acknowledge new risks introduced by relying on technology. We should add a section in the risk analysis about technology risk – e.g., model errors or data breaches. For instance, if our AI valuation model is wrong, it could lead to a bad purchase. To mitigate, we state that all AI-generated outputs will be reviewed by experienced team members (AI augments, not replaces, human judgement – as Luxury Presence noted, AI can’t replace the human touch in real estate
luxurypresence.com
). We also commit to keeping data secure and following best practices (especially if we gather data via the WhatsApp assistant, ensure it’s stored safely). By highlighting these, we show that we are aware and prepared to manage tech-related risks. 7. Branding & Marketing Narrative: Our story to investors and stakeholders now includes innovation. We should update our pitch and marketing materials to tout our AI approach – e.g., “Framework Detroit combines real estate savvy with cutting-edge AI analysis to maximize returns and community impact.” This can be woven into the mission statement or executive summary of the plan. We balance it with our community focus: perhaps something like “By using advanced technology to make data-driven decisions, we aim to direct capital efficiently to the Detroit properties that need it most, aligning investor returns with community revitalization.” This way, AI is presented as a tool that furthers our purpose (not as a gimmick). In marketing channels, sharing the fact that we use an AI-driven process can also attract interest (it’s newsworthy/novel in local real estate). We can even write blog posts about how we use AI in our work, establishing thought leadership. In summary, the incorporation of AI and an AI assistant requires revisions throughout the business plan – from strategy and operations to financials and marketing. These updates emphasize that Framework Detroit is innovating in a space ripe for disruption, which can impress investors (showing we strive for efficiency and higher returns) and reassure partners that we intend to stay ahead of the curve. The core mission of community revitalization stays the same, but our methods get an upgrade. This alignment of purpose and innovation is a central theme of the updated plan.
AI Personal Assistant (WhatsApp-Based) – Plan & Requirements
One of the most impactful initiatives is the creation of an AI-powered personal assistant chatbot, accessible via WhatsApp, to assist the team with property analysis. This tool will function as a deal analyst that fits in your pocket – by simply texting an address, team members (or potentially anyone we authorize) can receive a comprehensive analysis of a property within minutes. Below is a detailed plan for this AI assistant, including functionality, technical architecture, data sources, and improvements. Use Case & User Flow:
Query via WhatsApp: A user (initially, Framework Detroit team members or partners) sends a WhatsApp message to the company’s designated number with a property address (e.g., "123 Main St, Detroit"). We will set up a WhatsApp Business API or integrate via a service like Twilio to programmatically handle incoming messages.
Data Retrieval: Upon receiving an address, the assistant’s backend service triggers data collection routines:
Zillow Data: The system will query Zillow (or an alternative real estate data API) for information on the property. This includes current Zestimate or list price, property details (beds, baths, square footage, year built, lot size), and importantly the photos if available. Zillow’s platforms have millions of photos and even provide an AI-driven Zestimate that weighs visual features
geekwire.com
contempothemes.com
. We can leverage Zillow’s API for property details (Zillow has an API for home valuation and property data) – if direct API access is limited, we may use a third-party aggregator like RapidAPI or simply scrape the needed info (respecting terms of service). The photos URLs can often be extracted; these will be fed into our computer vision module.
Detroit Parcel Data: Next, the assistant will fetch public data about the property. Detroit has open parcel data (ownership info, lot dimensions, tax assessments) and possibly data on code violations or Detroit Land Bank status. By integrating with Detroit’s open data portal or GIS API, the assistant can pull info such as last sale date/price, property tax valuation, and whether the property is government-owned or privately owned. This adds context (e.g., if it’s Land Bank-owned, the acquisition process differs; if taxes are delinquent, that’s noteworthy).
Comparable Sales and Market Data: The assistant will also gather comps – recent sales of similar homes nearby – either through Zillow (they often list comps) or by querying a service like Redfin’s API or MLS data if accessible. This will help in valuation and exit strategy. Additionally, neighborhood data like average rent, crime rate, or school ratings could be included if readily available via APIs; these factors might influence strategy (for instance, a high-rent area might favor a hold and rent exit).
Analysis & Algorithmic Processing: Once data is collected, the assistant runs its proprietary algorithm to analyze the investment:
Property Condition via Photos: Using computer vision (CV), the assistant inspects each available photo of the property. It will be trained to detect visible issues and features. For example, it might recognize a damaged roof, old HVAC units, mold or water stains, outdated kitchen/bath finishes, etc. We can utilize a pre-trained model (like a TensorFlow or PyTorch model trained on housing images) and fine-tune it with known examples. Notably, Zillow itself uses neural networks to assess curb appeal and interior quality from photos
contempothemes.com
, and tools like Restb.ai offer property image recognition that can tag conditions and even predict valuation impact
contempothemes.com
contempothemes.com
. Our system can incorporate such technology – either via an API from a provider like Restb.ai or an open-source model – to get a structured assessment of condition. For example, the output might be: “Roof: poor (visible missing shingles), Kitchen: outdated (20+ years old cabinets), Windows: new, Paint: needs redo, etc.” Each item could be rated or flagged.
Automated Scope of Work: Based on the detected issues, the assistant generates a draft Scope of Work – essentially a checklist of recommended renovations. This could be rule-based initially (e.g., if roof poor => “Replace roof shingles”; if kitchen outdated => “Kitchen remodel (new cabinets, appliances)”), with generic descriptions. Revive’s AI similarly produces a “renovation game plan with total budget and ROI gain” for agents in seconds

, which validates our approach. Our system will also cross-reference standard cost assumptions for each task to estimate costs. For example, roof replacement: $X per sq ft, kitchen remodel: $Y per sq ft, etc. We can use national averages adjusted for Detroit or input our own cost data. The result: a list of tasks with cost estimates and perhaps a timeframe estimate for each.
Financial Pro Forma: With the scope and costs, plus the acquisition price (from Zillow or assumed), the assistant creates a basic pro forma financial projection. This should include: purchase price + closing costs, renovation costs, holding costs (like 6 months of taxes, insurance, financing interest if any), and then either resale value (ARV) if flip or rental income if hold. The output would be key metrics like projected profit if flipped, ROI (return on cost), estimated ARV vs investment, or if a rental scenario, cap rate and cash-on-cash return. It will also incorporate our deal-approval metrics: for instance, highlight if Return on Cost >30% (pass) or not (fail)
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. The comparables fetched can be used to estimate ARV (e.g., average $/sqft of nearby renovated sales times our sq footage). If the property as-is price is known, we compare our total cost to ARV to ensure target profit. Essentially, this step gives a go/no-go indication: is this deal likely profitable under various strategies?
Strategy Recommendation: Using the above analysis, the assistant formulates a purchase and exit strategy recommendation. For example: “Suggested acquisition strategy: Offer up to $50,000 (given needed repairs) and use a hard money loan at 8% (Kiavi/Roc360) if available, to leverage capital. Recommended exit: Fix-and-flip with a 5-month rehab, projected ARV $100,000, yielding ~20% net margin. Alternatively, as a rental, the property could rent for ~$1,000/mo, giving a 1.0% rent-to-value ratio, which meets our 0.9% threshold
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
, so holding is viable if financing at <=6% interest.” The recommendation algorithm will consider factors like: does it meet flip ROI criteria? If not, would it meet rental yield criteria? How is the neighborhood trend (if rising, maybe hold for appreciation)? It will be somewhat rule-based combined with any predictive model we develop for market trends. Over time, as we get data on our deals, we can refine these recommendations using machine learning (perhaps even train a classifier on deals we did vs passed on and their outcomes).
Formatting the Report: The data and insights are compiled into a report. This can be a PDF document or a web-based report (for ease, maybe a web page behind a short link). The report will include: Property summary (bed/bath, location, Zillow info), condition findings (perhaps with small thumbnails of photos and notes like “see water damage in photo”), the scope of work with cost estimates, the pro forma table, and the recommended strategy with key justifications. We will brand the report with Framework Detroit’s logo and maybe a disclaimer (AI-generated preliminary analysis, not a formal appraisal, etc.). A clear layout will help users quickly grasp the opportunity.
Delivery: The assistant then responds to the WhatsApp query with a short message summarizing results and a link to the full report. E.g., “FrameworkAI: 123 Main St – Estimated ARV $100k, Rehab $30k, Potential Profit ~$15k. Recommended: Flip. Details: [report link]”. The link could be a secure web link (maybe to our website domain, e.g., a hidden page or a PDF file in cloud storage). Using a link keeps the WhatsApp message concise and avoids huge text walls. If the user prefers, we could also allow a command like "summary" to get just a text summary in chat, and "full report" for the link.
Technical Architecture:
Frontend/Interface: WhatsApp is the UI. We will use the WhatsApp Business API (or Twilio’s WhatsApp sandbox during development) to connect. Essentially, WhatsApp messages will be received by a webhook in our system. No separate mobile app or UI is needed for now, which lowers friction – everyone is familiar with texting. For admin control, we might later build a simple web dashboard to see queries made, view reports, or re-run analysis, but that’s optional.
Backend Engine: This will be a server (cloud-hosted, e.g., on AWS Lambda or a small EC2 server, or a Heroku/DigitalOcean app) running the logic. It needs the following components:
Messaging handler: code to parse incoming messages (likely in Python or Node.js, as both have libraries for WhatsApp API). It will extract the address text.
Data fetcher: modules or services to call external APIs (Zillow, etc.). Zillow API may require OAuth or keys, we’ll set those up. For city data, possibly an API key for Detroit Open Data. Each of these calls returns JSON data that we then parse. (We should build in some error handling: if an address is not found or Zillow has no data, the assistant should respond with an apology or request clarification.)
Computer Vision module: possibly a separate service (for heavy processing). If using a cloud AI service (like Google Vision or a specialized real estate CV API), we’d send photos and get labels back. Alternatively, run an on-server model – which might require a GPU depending on model size. Since speed is a factor (we want results in perhaps 1-2 minutes), using a pre-trained API might be simplest initially. For instance, Restb.ai offers an API that can return property condition tags
contempothemes.com
. That could fast-track development. We’ll weigh the costs of using an API vs. building our own model. Early on, an API with per-use fees might be fine given low volume; long-term, training our own model (with sufficient data) could be more cost-effective and customizable.
Analysis & business logic: The core algorithm, which can be implemented in Python (using Pandas for number crunching, etc.). This will take the fetched data and CV results as inputs and apply our formulas/rules. We might code the financial model logic here explicitly (e.g., profit = ARV - purchasePrice - rehabCost - holdingCost). We’ll incorporate the criteria from our business plan (like the thresholds for ROI, etc.) into these calculations. Part of this logic could also involve calling a generative AI (like GPT) to produce the narrative of the recommendation, to make the output more readable. For example, after calculating everything, we could prompt an LLM with something like: “Summarize the investment opportunity for {address} given the following data... and make a recommendation.” This could yield a nicely worded few paragraphs which we can include in the report. OpenAI’s APIs or similar could handle that, albeit with careful prompt design to keep it factual and concise.
Database: We will maintain a log of queries and results. A simple database (SQL or even a Google Sheet/Airtable via API) can suffice initially. We want to store: the address queried, date, raw data pulled, the generated analysis (scope items and estimates), and the final report link. This database becomes a knowledge base of evaluated properties. Team members can search it later (“Did we analyze this one before?”). It also provides training data – we can add a column later like "Deal pursued? Y/N and outcome" to measure how the AI’s recommendations fared. All data should be timestamped and perhaps include who queried (if multi-user).
Report generator: To create the PDF or webpage. One approach is to use a PDF generation library (like ReportLab in Python or an HTML-to-PDF service) to compile the text and images into a nicely formatted PDF. Alternatively, host an HTML report: since we already have a website, we could create a template and fill it with data, then host it at a unique URL (like frameworkdetroit.com/reports/123MainSt-<date>). The advantage of HTML is interactive elements or easier viewing on mobile (PDFs on WhatsApp might force download). However, PDF is more shareable as a fixed document. We might implement both: send the link which opens a web page with the analysis, and have a button to download PDF. The report will include our branding and a disclaimer (perhaps “For internal use – AI-generated analysis, subject to verification”).
Security & Access: Initially, we will restrict usage to our team (maybe by checking the sender’s phone number against an authorized list). We don’t want random people using it and certainly not relying on it without context. As it matures, we could consider inviting select partners or even beta-testing with investor friends, but with caution. Data pulled from APIs should be handled per their terms of use (especially Zillow, which might limit commercial usage of their data – we’d aim to keep it in-house). Also, we should secure the backend endpoints (use API keys, HTTPS) because the system will have access to sensitive data and expensive API calls.
Performance Considerations: Each query triggers multiple network calls and computations. We expect a response time maybe on the order of 30 seconds to 2 minutes for full analysis (depends on image count and API speeds). That’s acceptable for now (we can have the bot send a “Working on it...” message if needed). We will design the system to handle one query at a time initially, which is fine with a small team. If we later scale it or have overlapping queries, we might need to queue tasks or increase computing resources. Using cloud functions or containers, we can scale out if needed.
Development Plan & Costs:
Building this AI assistant is a significant project, likely the most technically complex part of our plan. We will approach it in stages:
Phase 1 – MVP (Minimal Viable Product): Focus on the core outcome – given an address, get basic data and return a simple analysis (value and maybe a simple yes/no on deal viability). In the MVP, we might skip advanced image analysis and instead use simpler heuristics: e.g., just use Zillow’s data (like Zestimate vs listing price, year built as proxy for condition) and output a rough recommendation. This could be done relatively quickly (a few weeks of coding and testing) and gives us a working prototype to demonstrate the concept. We’ll use MVP to gather feedback and ensure the WhatsApp workflow is convenient.
Phase 2 – Incorporate Computer Vision & Detailed Scope: Once MVP is stable, integrate the photo analysis for granular rehab planning. This involves either integrating a third-party CV API (fastest route) or training a model (longer route). Given time constraints, using an existing AI service (like the Revive AI approach or Restb.ai) is sensible. We will budget for API usage costs here – often these services charge per image or per analysis. For example, if it’s a few cents per image, analyzing say 20 photos might cost $1 per property, which is reasonable for internal use. We should budget a few hundred dollars for initial testing and usage. If volume grows, we revisit the cost structure (maybe negotiate enterprise rates or switch to our own model).
Phase 3 – Expansion and Refinement: Add more data sources (rental data, neighborhood stats), refine cost estimates with our project data, and incorporate user feedback. Perhaps add the ability to adjust assumptions via chat (e.g., user can text "assume ARV 110k" or "what if rent is 1200?" and the assistant recalculates – a conversational aspect). Also consider adding conversational Q&A – after the report, the user could ask follow-ups like "Why flip instead of rent?" or "Show me the comps used," and an AI (likely an LLM) could answer based on the report data. This turns the tool into more of an interactive analyst, not just a static report generator.
Phase 4 – User Expansion & Frontend: If we see value, we might let external parties use a limited version. For example, maybe our investors could query an address of a property they are considering investing in with us. Or a website visitor could get a simple “enter address for an instant quote” (this enters territory of becoming a product in itself). For now, Phase 4 is optional and beyond the current scope, but we keep it in mind.
In terms of development effort, if done in-house by a team member with coding experience, this could take 2-3 months for a solid V1 (including learning curve on WhatsApp API, integrating various data sources, testing CV outputs, etc.). If we outsource to a developer or firm, costs could vary widely. A high-end estimate for a custom AI-driven app like this could be in the tens of thousands of dollars (some sources cite $100k+ for sophisticated real estate AI platforms)
biz4group.com
biz4group.com
. However, by starting with an MVP and using pre-built components, we can likely keep the initial version in the lower range. We’ll aim to keep development lean by using existing APIs and open-source libraries. Additionally, focusing on essential features first (MVP) is a known cost-saving approach in AI development
biz4group.com
, helping us deliver value early without overspending on nice-to-have features. Potential Challenges:
Data accuracy: The assistant’s outputs are only as good as the data and models. Zillow’s estimates or our CV might sometimes be off. We’ll need to routinely sanity-check the results, especially early on. For instance, if the AI suggests an ARV too high, we catch it and recalibrate. Over-reliance without verification is dangerous. So our roll-out plan internally will be to use the assistant as a guide, but still double-check critical numbers before making big decisions.
API limits and changes: Zillow or others could rate-limit or change access. We should have backup plans (like an alternative data source or a way to quickly update the integration). Maybe diversify data sources (use multiple listing sites or a paid data provider like ATTOM if necessary in future).
WhatsApp message formatting: We have to ensure the messages and links come through clearly. WhatsApp has message templates for business accounts; we will comply with their policies (like needing user opt-in, etc.). We might start testing in a sandbox environment and then apply for a WhatsApp Business number.
User adoption: Even within the team, adopting a new tool can have a learning curve. We will provide a simple one-page guide on how to use the assistant and what commands are available. After a few uses, it should become second nature to just message our AI for quick analysis.
Impact and Benefits:
Once running, this assistant could save substantial time in our acquisition process. What might take hours of an analyst’s work (pulling comps, calling contractors for rough bids, calculating returns) will be delivered almost instantly. This speed means we can put in offers faster and with more confidence. It also standardizes our analysis – every property is evaluated with the same framework, reducing oversight. Moreover, it creates a data repository of all analyses, which is invaluable for learning (we can look back and see why we decided something and how it turned out). The tool also impresses others; showing a lender or partner an AI-driven report could boost our credibility as a savvy operation. In essence, this AI assistant will serve as a tireless junior analyst that works 24/7. It won’t replace human decisions, but it will ensure we have robust data at our fingertips for each decision. And as mentioned, similar innovations are already proving effective: Revive’s Vision AI gives agents renovation plans in seconds
wavgroup.com
, and Zillow’s AI-driven analytics have improved valuation accuracy significantly
contempothemes.com
. We are bringing those cutting-edge capabilities in-house, tailored to our specific investment strategy in Detroit. Example Scenario:
To illustrate, suppose a wholesaler texts us about a new off-market deal on a Saturday. Instead of waiting until Monday to do research, we (or even the wholesaler, if we allow) text the address to our WhatsApp assistant. Within a minute, we receive: “3-bed/1-bath, 1500 sqft built 1940. Est. value $120k if renovated (~$80/sqft). Needs ~$30k work (roof, paint, kitchen update). Flip profit ~$20k or 22% ROI at $60k purchase. Rental est. $1,200/mo (1.0% RV). Recommendation: pursue purchase up to $65k; flip for resale at ~$120k; meets criteria (ROI >30% on cost including financing). Report: [link].” We quickly glance – it meets our ROI target and the scope seems manageable. We decide to schedule a viewing immediately and possibly secure the contract before others. All thanks to our AI speeding up the analysis. That’s the power we aim to harness.
Additional Improvements & Future Considerations
In developing these plans, we identified several areas for future improvement to ensure longevity and maximum impact of our initiatives. As a concluding section, we outline some recommendations and ideas beyond the current scope that could further improve Framework Detroit’s tech integration:
Continuous AI Learning: Build a feedback loop for the AI assistant. After each project, feed the actual outcomes (actual renovation cost, actual sale price or rent, actual timeline) back into the system. This can refine the algorithm’s predictions over time (a form of machine learning model updating). Essentially, the more we use it, the smarter it gets. We should document discrepancies (e.g., if AI estimated rehab $30k but it ended up $40k, why? What was missed?) and adjust the model or add new rules to cover those cases.
Expanding Data Sources: To improve accuracy, integrate more data. For example, incorporate MLS data through a partnership or service – that could give more detailed comps and maybe more photos. Use economic indicators like interest rates or local employment trends in the analysis for exit strategy (e.g., if interest rates spike, maybe flipping strategy adjusts or holding period changes). Pull in rental market data from sources like Rentometer or Zillow Rent Index to better evaluate buy-and-hold scenarios. The richer the data, the better the insight (though be mindful of overloading the user with too much info; keep the report focused).
User Interface Enhancements: While WhatsApp is convenient, in the future we might also want a web or mobile app interface for the assistant. A dashboard where one can input an address (or multiple addresses in bulk) and get analyses could be useful, especially if the team grows or if we use it in an office setting. This could also allow fine-tuning parameters (like adjusting the rehab budget or desired profit margin on the fly). A web UI could integrate maps (e.g., showing where comps are on a map) for richer context that’s not possible in a WhatsApp text.
Collaboration & Sharing: Extend the tools to collaborate with partners. For instance, if we work with certain investors, we could share a subset of the AI’s report with them to keep them informed or to jointly evaluate deals. We could have a feature to generate a “clean” version of the report (without our internal thresholds perhaps) to share externally. This transparency can build trust with investors or lenders (showing the thorough analysis backing each deal).
Integration with Pipeline Management: As we adopt tools like Notion or any CRM to track our deal pipeline (one of the next steps
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
), we should integrate the AI outputs into that workflow. For example, the assistant could automatically create a new entry in a Google Sheet or Notion database for each address analyzed, populated with key fields (price, est. ARV, etc.). This avoids duplicate data entry and ensures our pipeline tracker is always up to date with the latest analysis.
AI for Property Management (Longer-term): Once we start holding properties (rentals) significantly, we can use AI to assist in property management too. Chatbots for tenant inquiries, AI scheduling for maintenance (predicting when a furnace might fail based on age and use patterns), or even dynamic pricing for rents similar to how hotels/airlines do (if we have multiple units). This isn’t immediate, but planning for it aligns with possibly getting into multi-family or larger portfolios as mentioned in the vision (e.g., “20+ doors” goal
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
).
Community and Ethical Considerations: Since our mission involves community development, we should consider using AI ethically and in ways that benefit the community. For example, we could share some of our neighborhood analysis insights with city planners or community organizations to support broader revitalization efforts. Also, ensure our AI doesn’t inadvertently perpetuate biases (like undervaluing certain neighborhoods due to historical data that reflects redlining etc.). We might have to consciously adjust or override purely data-driven outputs to align with our purpose-driven mission. This could be an improvement where we program the AI to align with our values (e.g., maybe include a “community impact score” in our evaluations if data available, so we favor projects that also remove blight or provide affordable housing, not just the highest profit).
Marketing the AI Capability: Once proven internally, our AI-driven approach can itself be a marketing point. We can publish a case study on our blog about how using the AI assistant enabled us to, say, complete X deals in record time or avoid a bad deal that looked good on surface. This positions us as innovators and can attract media attention or investor interest. Essentially, turn our internal tool into part of our brand story (“tech meets real estate in Detroit”). We must, however, be careful not to give away any proprietary secret sauce if we consider it a competitive advantage.
Cost Management: Continuously monitor the cost of these tech initiatives. AI APIs, hosting, development – they add operational costs. But as long as the ROI (either through cost savings or increased profits) is positive, it’s justified. We should track metrics like how much time the AI saves (hours of analysis avoided) and how that translates to money (if we would have had to hire an analyst otherwise, etc.). Also track if AI-led decisions perform better or if deals found via AI yield higher returns. This helps prove the value of the investment in tech.
Staying Updated: The AI field is rapidly evolving. New models, APIs, and techniques emerge yearly. We should allocate time to stay updated (reading industry news, maybe attending proptech meetups or conferences). For instance, if a new AI service comes that can predict house prices even more accurately or some startup offers an API for rehab cost estimation specifically, we might integrate that instead of reinventing the wheel. Being flexible and modular in our implementation will allow swapping in better components as they come. It may even be worthwhile in the future to partner with a tech company or join a pilot program for real estate AI to get early access to new tools.
Finally, as a summary of impact, these improvements and the overall plan aim to make Framework Detroit a data-driven, efficient, and innovative real estate enterprise. By having a strong online presence and leveraging AI at multiple touchpoints, the company is positioned to punch above its weight – doing more with a small team, making informed decisions quickly, and appealing to stakeholders who value both profit and progress. We will revisit this PRD regularly as we implement features, checking off accomplishments (like the website launch, the first successful AI-assisted deal analysis) and updating it as new features or needs arise. This is a living roadmap guiding Framework Detroit’s next steps in combining real estate acumen with technological prowess, driving us closer to our vision of 20+ revitalized properties and a rejuvenated Detroit community.

Based on estimates for each component within a house that we know or have an estimate amount per square foot, we can give a condition of the house, and that condition tells us what percentage of the estimated amount per square foot we need. So if it's in good condition, we may need 30% of it. If it's in great condition, it may be 10%. In excellent condition, we may need nothing from it. And so we'll start by making assumptions about each component. And then even more so, we're going to make assumptions about each component within the components. So plumbing means like the plumbing rings, it means the PEX piping, it means any levers and switches that are needed for the PEX piping, includes a gas line, it includes studs, it includes drywall, like all the specific, plumbing doesn't, but I'm just giving an example that all the specific things cost a certain amount. And more so, all those specific things probably can be broken down into a cost per square foot as well. All right, so as we go through houses, we can come up with estimates by walking through and seeing whether or not specific components of the house are in good or great condition. And based on that, we can finally figure out what the cost of things are, what the true estimate will be. And we can have a list, like a master list of the cost for each types of items. And based on this master list, that's where we're going to input into the system. So if we know that a window costs $600, we're going to have that in our master list, and we'll update that over time. And we can give, we can allow chatDBT to update it based on the link's current pricing as well. But for certain things that, like for example, labor, more than likely we'll be updating that since it's not as easy to look up. Or if we get a certain deal on a certain item, we'll be able to manually add that in. So, yes, we'll have a task of going to a house, looking at the lawn, figuring out the square footage of the lawn, looking at the fence, how long the fence is and what condition it's in, the stairs, the porch, so on and so forth. And we'll be able to take the audio of it. So we're going to use Otter to create transcripts. And then we'll upload that transcript to the system. And that system will go through and figure out all the items that we gave a condition of and give a specific number for that. And based on the overall properties condition, meaning if it's gutted, then if we don't mention it, we can just assume that we actually do need it. If it's a cosmetic upgrade, maybe there's some assumptions there that. There are certain features of the house that we don't need to replace immediately, and so, you know, maybe it's just a lower percentage of that percentage of that amount. So for plumbing, we don't have to do the whole plumbing, the whole house plumbing, but we're going to fix some fixtures and maybe that that amounts to like 10 percent of. But we should say it in the walkthrough if we're going to do that. And so, you know, we're going to make some assumptions about some things and then for the numbers that we actually speak to, we'll be a bit more precise. So, for example, I would like to have the ability to. Send you an address. And then I would like to have the ability to send you an email address, send you an address and say it's completely got it. You'll be able to look up information about that address, including the pictures, and you'll be able to make some assumptions about the condition of the property and what needs to be fixed based on those pictures. You'll be able to take as audio input. And this will just like, you know, social priority of what's, you know, what's true. We'll just if I go in and say, you know, it has to be fixed and it has to be fixed versus if you look at the video, look at the pictures and it says that, you know, something needs to replace. But I say it doesn't need to be replaced. And, you know, I went on that. And so the cost is adjusted there. And. And so, yeah, so I go to the house, I do the walkthrough and I record the transcript of things that I noticed in the house that is then updated to the system. And from that, you pull out all the items in the house that need to be fixed and we make some estimates based on that. And then we can also, you know, this should also include, obviously, like mortgage costs, hard money, loan costs, cash costs. And, you know, it should also include like amount of time to complete the project. And it can also include like a or a order of things to do in the house based on, you know, later on, we'll be able to upload the inspection report as well. And, you know, it should give us a list, a prioritized list of items that need to be addressed. Or fix, and, you know, the most logical order to actually fix them. We'll also upload diagrams of the house using the my map maker or something like some tool that allows you to create the outline of the house. So you can see like how big the house is, where each room is, so on and so forth. And we'll be able to use that as part of the input into the tool. So maybe there's a dashboard that displays that somewhere. And the goal of this is so that, you know, we can look at an address and decide whether or not to go and look at an address and figure out what it's going to cost for that address. And we'd also like you to be able to, you know, scan a list of addresses or maybe like, you know, keep a pulse on the newest listings and figure out the cost for all the newest listings. And, you know, most updated listings, so on and so forth. So that, you know, we can just look up an address and you've already done part of the pro forma because, you know, you're updating this regularly and you're also sending out like emails regularly for. The most important. Listings or the listings that. Seem the most logical to pursue.


make this into a better prompt. ensure all ideas are added to the prompt for deep research in order to build out a system of api's to complete this (mcp apis). with a priority of getting something live as soon as possible. and iterate and improve it through phases. 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a polished and complete prompt, structured for deep research and development planning (e.g. to guide a technical team or AI builder like MCP) with clear phases, all ideas captured, and a bias toward getting a working MVP live fast:

Prompt Title: AI-Driven Rehab Estimation and Property Evaluation System (Framework Detroit MVP)

Objective:
Create an intelligent real estate analysis system composed of interconnected APIs and AI components designed to automate rehab cost estimation, acquisition strategy, and project planning based on a property’s condition, photos, and user input (via audio, video, images, or text). The system must prioritize launching a functional MVP as fast as possible, with clear support for iteration and expansion in later phases.

🔧 Core Features and Inputs:
1. Property Input Methods:

A user should be able to:

Text an address via WhatsApp or web form.

Upload or link Zillow/MLS listing photos.

Upload or dictate an audio walkthrough, transcribed with Otter or similar.

Upload or draw a floor plan or room layout using a tool like MagicPlan or MyMeasure.

Optionally upload an inspection report PDF.

2. Component-Level Condition Evaluation:

Create a master component list: each major system (roof, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, windows, etc.) broken into granular subcomponents (e.g., for plumbing: PEX piping, valves, fixtures, shutoffs, etc.).

For each component, assign:

Unit cost per square foot (or per item) from a master pricing list.

A condition-based cost multiplier (e.g., Excellent = 0%, Good = 30%, Poor = 100%).

Ability to override default multipliers manually per walkthrough or transcript.

3. Condition Inference Pipeline:

Infer component conditions from:

User transcript (speech-to-text) – prioritize explicit user statements.

Photo analysis using computer vision (e.g., detect mold, roof damage, outdated kitchens).

Default assumptions based on property type and age (e.g., gutted home = assume 100% replacement unless specified).

If conditions conflict between the AI and the walkthrough transcript, default to human statement.

4. Cost Estimation Engine:

Estimate labor and material costs based on:

Component conditions × unit prices.

Localized labor costs (manually updated or set as defaults per zip code).

Historic discounts or vendor-specific pricing (e.g., “we always get these lights for $30 from X”).

Include mortgage/hard money loan calculators, holding cost estimates, and project timelines.

Output: Total rehab cost, holding + acquisition cost, estimated ARV, projected profit.

5. Prioritized Scope of Work & Task Order:

Framework Detroit Real Estate – AI Integration & Website PRD
Introduction
Framework Real Estate Solutions, LLC ("Framework Detroit") is a Detroit-based real estate startup with a mission to revitalize local neighborhoods through thoughtful rehabs and community-focused investments
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance Framework Detroit’s business plan with technology initiatives, including a new company website, integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into business operations, and the development of an AI-driven personal assistant (via WhatsApp). By leveraging modern web design and AI tools, Framework Detroit aims to improve its operational efficiency, investment decision-making, marketing outreach, and overall value proposition. The outcome of these initiatives will be an updated business plan that incorporates AI-driven strategies and a clear roadmap for implementation. Objectives:
Launch an Official Website & Branding: Establish a professional web presence (frameworkdetroit.com) featuring the company’s portfolio, pipeline of projects, investor portal, and blog
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. Develop consistent branding (including business cards and logos) to support marketing and credibility.
Integrate AI into the Business: Identify and implement AI solutions across core business areas (deal sourcing, underwriting, marketing, and operations) to gain efficiency and competitive advantage. According to McKinsey, real estate companies effectively using AI have seen >10% increases in net operating income through efficiency gains, better customer experiences, and smarter asset selection
mckinsey.com
. Leveraging AI will help Framework Detroit become a tech-forward firm in a traditionally tech-slow industry
mckinsey.com
.
Develop an AI Property Analysis Assistant: Create an AI-powered personal assistant (accessible via WhatsApp) that team members can query with a property address to automatically gather data (from Zillow, city parcel records, etc.), analyze property condition from photos, and generate investment recommendations (purchase/acquisition strategy, rehab scope, pro forma financials). This tool will drastically reduce analysis time – tasks that once took days could be done in seconds with AI
wavgroup.com
 – and ensure consistent deal evaluations.
Continuously Improve & Innovate: Establish a feedback loop to refine the AI tools and website, and explore additional features (e.g. advanced analytics, predictive models, or customer-facing AI services) to maintain a competitive edge.
The sections below detail the plan for each component, including scope, requirements, architecture, cost considerations, and how it aligns with Framework Detroit’s updated business strategy.
Website Development Plan (Architecture & Cost)
Purpose & Features: The company website (proposed at frameworkdetroit.com) will be the digital hub for Framework Detroit’s brand and operations. Per the initial business plan, the site will include: a project portfolio of past and current rehabs, a pipeline section for upcoming deals, an investor contact portal for prospective investors, and a blog to share updates and insights
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. Additionally, the site should incorporate basic company information (mission, team, contact info) and potentially a login-protected area for partner or investor materials if needed. Integrating case studies of projects (before-and-after details, community impact) is key, as noted in the marketing plan
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. The website will also support lead generation (e.g. a form for investors or property sellers to get in touch) and be optimized for SEO (search engine visibility) and Google My Business listing, consistent with the branding strategy
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. Architecture & Tech Stack: For a fast and cost-effective launch, the site can be built on a Content Management System (CMS) or modern web framework:
Option 1: CMS (e.g. WordPress or Wix) – This offers quick deployment with templates, plugins for portfolios and blogs, and easy content updates. A WordPress-based real estate site with custom design typically costs in the $2,000–$10,000 range
attck.com
, with lower costs if using standard templates and higher if custom development is needed. Maintenance is straightforward, though security updates must be applied regularly.
Option 2: Custom Web Application (e.g. React/Next.js frontend + Node/Python backend) – This would allow more flexibility (e.g. a tailored investor portal, integration with internal databases), at higher initial development effort. A custom real estate website can cost $20,000+ depending on complexity
iihglobal.com
. Given our current needs (mainly content display and contact forms), a full custom build may be unnecessary; however, we might use custom elements within a CMS (like a plugin or embedded web app for the investment pipeline data).
The website architecture will likely follow a standard model:
Frontend: Responsive web pages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with a clean, modern design that reflects Detroit’s vibe and the company’s community-driven mission. Emphasize visuals (property photos, Detroit neighborhood imagery) to make the site engaging. Ensure mobile-friendly design (many users/investors will browse on phones).
Backend: If using a CMS, the backend is largely provided by the platform (e.g. WordPress PHP/MySQL environment). If custom, set up a server (cloud-hosted) with a database to store project data, user inquiries, etc. For scalability and security, a cloud hosting (like AWS, Azure, or managed WordPress hosting) is recommended. Hosting costs can range from $5–10/month for basic shared hosting up to a few hundred for robust cloud setups
attck.com
attck.com
; initially, a modest hosting plan ($20/month) should suffice, with the ability to upgrade as traffic grows.
Database: Likely needed to store content such as project details and blog posts (though a CMS handles this internally). If an investor portal with user accounts is included down the line, a secure database for user data would be required.
Integration: Include a contact form or investor portal that emails submissions to the team (or stores them in a CRM). Possibly integrate with the company’s Google Workspace for email and document hosting. Future integration could include live chat or a chatbot (e.g. an AI assistant popup for site visitors, which can be an extension of our WhatsApp assistant logic).
Security & Compliance: Use SSL for the site (HTTPS), implement basic security hardening (especially if using a CMS, to prevent common vulnerabilities), and ensure compliance with privacy laws for any user data collected (display a privacy policy and obtain consent for contact forms). Use reliable plugins/services for forms to avoid spam.
Design & Branding: The site’s design will align with Framework Detroit’s branding. A logo should be finalized and used on the site and business collateral. The color scheme might draw inspiration from Detroit’s heritage (for instance, earthy tones or the city’s flag colors) to resonate locally. We will also produce business cards and stationery with the same branding. A consistent visual identity across the website, business cards, and social media will enhance professionalism. Business Cards: Design high-quality cards featuring the logo, contact info, and tagline (“Rebuilding Detroit with Purpose.”) to use in networking and community events – while not a digital product, this is a quick win for marketing and should be part of the branding package in the website project timeline. Content Plan: Populate the site with initial content:
Portfolio: Profiles of at least 1-2 completed or in-progress projects (with photos, descriptions, investment stats, community impact notes).
Pipeline: If appropriate to share, highlight upcoming target properties or neighborhoods (could be general, e.g. “Focusing on Fitzgerald and Bagley neighborhoods
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
” without giving away exact addresses). This shows momentum but be careful not to reveal sensitive deal info publicly.
Investor Portal: Provide information for potential investors (e.g. overview of investment strategy, FAQs, a form to contact for more info or to join a mailing list). In the future, this could evolve into a login area where verified investors can see detailed deal offerings.
Blog: Kick off with posts about the company’s mission and Detroit market insights. Regular updates (e.g. monthly) with project updates, Detroit real estate trends, or community stories will keep content fresh and improve SEO.
Cost Estimates: Based on industry data, a basic to mid-range real estate website with our feature set is expected to cost roughly $2,000 to $5,000 if using a template and in-house content creation, or up to $10,000+ if engaging a professional designer/developer for a custom look
iihglobal.com
attck.com
. We should budget additionally for:
Domain & Hosting: Domain ~$15/year, hosting ~$100–$300/year for a small site (scales up if traffic increases or if we need dedicated resources)
attck.com
.
Design Assets: Logo design might be a one-time cost (could range $0 if done by founders, up to ~$500 if hiring a freelance designer). Stock images or photography for the site may incur some cost if high-quality images of Detroit or properties are needed (or we can use our own project photos).
Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance ~5-10% of initial development cost per year
iihglobal.com
 – includes keeping software updated, content updates, minor tweaks, and security monitoring. Initially, this could be minimal if the site is small (the team can handle blog updates, etc.), but as the site grows, allocating a few hundred dollars per year or some internal time for maintenance is wise.
SEO and Marketing: While much can be done in-house (blogging, social media integration), we might consider an SEO tool or hiring expertise for optimization, which could be a few hundred dollars one-time or monthly if ongoing.
Timeline: A basic site can be up within 4–6 weeks. Key milestones:
Week 1-2: Finalize site map and content outline; choose platform (CMS vs custom) and gather design inspiration.
Week 2-4: Develop the site pages and features; iterate on design; implement contact form and any necessary plugins.
Week 4-5: Populate content (text and images); set up Google My Business profile and link to site; integrate Google Analytics.
Week 5-6: Testing across devices/browsers; SEO basics (meta tags, site description); security check; launch the site.
Post-launch: Monitor and fix any issues; announce the website on social media and to the company’s network.
Launching the website (and distributing new business cards) is also one of the immediate next steps identified in the original plan
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. It will establish credibility online and serve as a foundation for rolling out the more advanced AI-driven tools.
AI Integration Strategy for Business
To modernize operations and gain an edge, Framework Detroit will incorporate AI technologies throughout its business. This section outlines how AI can be leveraged in different domains of the company:
1. AI for Deal Sourcing & Underwriting
Opportunity Identification: Use predictive analytics on real estate data to find promising investment deals faster. AI models can analyze large datasets (MLS listings, public records, demographic trends) to flag properties or neighborhoods that fit our criteria (e.g. undervalued homes in target areas with high appreciation potential). Tools like Likely.AI and SmartZip already analyze past sales, ownership tenure, and market trends to predict who is likely to sell or which properties might be good targets
luxurypresence.com
. By inputting our focus neighborhoods and property type (single-family/duplex) into similar models, we can prioritize leads more efficiently than manual search. Automated Underwriting: Instead of manually combing through comps and spreadsheets for every prospective deal, AI can assist in preliminary underwriting. For example, an AI-driven valuation model could estimate a property's after-repair value (ARV) and optimal purchase price by learning from comparable sales and considering the property’s features. Zillow’s own AI has demonstrated high accuracy in image-based home valuation, achieving <2% error rates by analyzing property photos for condition and finishes
contempothemes.com
. We can leverage open APIs or train a custom model to estimate ARVs given raw data (square footage, beds/baths, location) combined with an image-based condition assessment (more on that below). Additionally, AI can rapidly calculate key metrics (ROI, rent-to-value, etc.) and check them against our criteria (e.g. Return on Cost > 30%, Net Margin ≥ 20% as per our current deal metrics
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
) to see if a deal is worth pursuing. This speeds up the screening process, focusing human attention only on deals that pass initial automated checks. Risk Assessment: Analytical AI can help flag potential red flags that might be buried in data. For instance, it could scan city permit or code violation data to warn of properties with past structural issues, or use natural language processing (NLP) to summarize inspection reports or seller disclosures. By training on historical project outcomes, an AI might even predict which rehab projects are likely to go over-budget or long on timeline (learning from factors like property age, neighborhood, contractor used, etc.), thus informing our decision to take on a project or not. While these models require data and refinement, building them gives a future advantage in risk management.
2. AI for Renovation Planning & Project Management
Rehabilitation is a core part of Framework’s business. AI can streamline and improve this process:
Scope of Work Generation: As detailed in the AI assistant plan (next section), computer vision can analyze property photos and automatically identify renovation needs. An AI that tags images with keywords (e.g. "outdated kitchen", "water damage ceiling", "old roof") can generate a draft scope of work for a property. This technology is already emerging – for example, Revive’s Vision AI tool analyzes listing photos and “estimates renovation costs, potential market value, and projected ROI,” then outputs a recommended improvement plan
wavgroup.com
. Using a similar approach, our system can not only speed up creating a rehab plan but also ensure we don’t overlook common issues.
Cost Estimation: Building on the scope, an AI model (trained on past rehab costs or industry data) can provide a rough cost estimate for each item. This would be continuously refined as we feed it actual cost data from our projects. (E.g., it learns typical costs to replace a roof of X square feet or remodel a bathroom in Detroit.) Over time, this improves budgeting accuracy. In early stages, we could integrate a third-party construction cost API or dataset to help price out the scope automatically.
Project Scheduling: AI optimization algorithms can help create efficient project schedules, sequencing tasks for optimal workflow and even adjusting timelines if delays occur. For instance, if we have multiple projects, a scheduling AI could allocate crews optimally or predict delays (like seasonality effects on exterior work).
Monitoring Progress: Using AI with cameras or drones (a future tool we noted
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
), we could potentially monitor job sites. While drone walkthroughs themselves are planned, adding an AI that compares work-in-progress photos to the plan can flag if something is behind schedule or done incorrectly. This is an advanced use case, but it’s on the horizon (some construction tech firms use AI for site monitoring
hover.to
).
Quality Control: AI can assist in quality checks by analyzing photos of completed work for defects or deviations (for example, detecting if paint coverage is even, or if debris remains after a clean-up). Though this is experimental, it could be explored in the long term.
3. AI for Marketing & Sales
Marketing is vital for attracting buyers, tenants, and investors. Generative AI can elevate our marketing efforts:
Property Listing Descriptions: When selling a rehabbed property, AI (like GPT-4) can craft compelling listing descriptions highlighting the best features. Agents already use AI to write listings in specific tones or to emphasize details for target buyer demographics
luxurypresence.com
luxurypresence.com
. We can input our renovation highlights and let AI draft a polished narrative, saving time and ensuring every listing is enticing and professional.
Virtual Staging & Visualization: Instead of physically staging every home, we can use AI virtual staging tools to add furniture and decor to photos of empty rooms. Tools like BoxBrownie or others use AI to insert life-like furniture and make spaces more attractive to buyers
luxurypresence.com
. This is cost-effective and fast. Additionally, if we list rentals, Matterport-style AI 3D tours can provide immersive remote walkthroughs
luxurypresence.com
. These tech-forward methods can make our properties stand out online and sell or rent faster.
Social Media & Content Creation: Maintaining a social presence (Instagram @FrameworkDetroit, as planned
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
) can be augmented with AI. AI tools can generate social media captions, hashtags, and even design graphics or short promo videos. For instance, an AI could automatically create a before-and-after image slider of a rehab with a catchy caption. Consistency here builds brand awareness. We can also utilize AI to analyze posting times and audience engagement to optimize our social media strategy.
SEO & Blog Writing: For our blog and investor newsletters, AI can help research and draft articles on Detroit market trends, investment tips, etc. We can feed local data (sales stats, rental rates) to a GPT-based tool to write market reports that we then lightly edit
luxurypresence.com
luxurypresence.com
. This provides valuable content to our investors and boosts our site’s SEO with relatively little manual writing.
Customer Engagement: Chatbot AI can handle routine inquiries from potential sellers or investors via the website. For example, a chatbot could answer frequently asked questions (“What areas do you invest in?”, “How does your process work?”) or collect lead information 24/7. This improves responsiveness without needing a full-time staffer to monitor chat. Luxury Presence reports that AI-powered lead nurture tools can reply to inbound messages immediately and increase lead response rates above 50%
luxurypresence.com
, which suggests we could capture more opportunities by not missing inquiries.
Investor Relations: For existing investors, AI can personalize updates. Imagine an AI that can automatically generate a short report for each investor on their portfolio with us (if we have multiple deals or a fund), highlighting key updates. While our scale is small initially, planning such capabilities sets the stage for when we have many investors to manage.
4. AI for Operations & Efficiency
Beyond deals and marketing, AI can improve internal efficiency:
Document Management: Real estate involves a lot of paperwork (contracts, leases, insurance, etc.). An AI document assistant can quickly retrieve information or even summarize legal documents. For instance, we could use NLP to query our repository of purchase agreements or contractor contracts (“Find the clause about termination in the GC contract”) and get an instant answer rather than manually searching. GenAI tools can also extract key points from dense documents
mckinsey.com
, reducing the time we spend on administrative review.
Communication and Scheduling: We can deploy AI to manage some of our communications. One idea is an AI email assistant that drafts routine emails (like responding to inquiries or scheduling site visits) for us to review and send. Also, for team coordination, an AI assistant could parse our calendars and suggest optimal meeting times or send reminders for deadlines (like permit renewal dates, insurance payments, etc.). These are small things individually, but they add up to significant time saved.
Training and Knowledge Capture: As the team grows, an internal AI knowledge base could help onboard new members. For example, feeding it our best practices, past project reports, and procedures would allow a chatbot to answer, “How do I pull comps?” or “What’s our process for pulling permits?” This keeps institutional knowledge accessible. It’s like a smart internal FAQ that learns from our documentation.
Analytical Dashboards: AI can automate the creation of financial or operational dashboards by pulling data from various sources (bank accounts, project budgets in spreadsheets, etc.) and presenting it in a cohesive way. This could help track our KPIs (profit margins, timelines, etc.) in real time. For instance, an AI script could fetch data from QuickBooks and output a weekly summary of expenses vs budget for each project.
Why This Matters: Incorporating AI into these areas will directly support our long-term vision. It enables scaling up effectively – with AI handling repetitive or complex analytical tasks, the small team can manage more projects (goal: 20+ properties in 3-5 years
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
) without a linear increase in manpower. It also differentiates Framework Detroit as a forward-thinking company. The real estate industry has historically lagged in tech adoption
mckinsey.com
, so by embracing AI early, we gain a competitive advantage. Early adopters can capture outsized gains – generative AI alone could create $110–$180 billion in new value in real estate, according to industry analysis
mckinsey.com
. Even on a small scale, more efficient operations and data-driven decisions can mean better deals and returns. In fact, real estate firms using AI have improved net income by over 10% through efficiency and smarter asset selection
mckinsey.com
. This potential upside justifies the investment in AI capabilities as part of our business plan. Of course, implementing these AI solutions will require resources (talent, software, possibly consulting). We plan to start small and focused (see the personal assistant below as our initial flagship AI project), then gradually expand AI initiatives as we learn and as the business grows. Continuous improvement and iteration are key: we’ll monitor the results of each AI integration, gather feedback from users (team or investors), and refine the tools to better meet our objectives.
Updated Business Plan Incorporating AI
By integrating the above technology plans, Framework Detroit’s overall business plan needs to be updated to reflect new capabilities, strategies, and goals. This section highlights the major updates to the business plan after incorporating AI and AI agents: 1. Value Proposition Enhancement: Framework Detroit is no longer just a traditional real estate rehab company; it becomes a tech-augmented real estate investment firm. The mission remains community revitalization, but we add that we leverage advanced technology (AI/ML) to identify opportunities and execute projects with greater speed and precision. This tech-driven edge means we can uncover value that others miss and adapt quickly to market signals. It’s worth mentioning in our company overview that our approach combines real estate expertise and data science to “rebuild Detroit with purpose – and efficiency.” This dual identity can attract not only real estate investors but also tech-savvy partners or those excited about innovation in housing. 2. Competitive Advantage: Our business plan’s market analysis should note that few local competitors are using AI in this space, giving Framework a first-mover advantage in Detroit. We can underwrite deals faster and more thoroughly. For example, if a distressed property hits the market, our AI tools can immediately analyze it (pull comps, estimate rehab needs) and we can make an informed offer faster than competitors. This speed is a competitive advantage in acquiring properties. Also, our use of AI for marketing (like better listings and wider outreach) can lead to faster sales at higher prices, improving our turnover rate and margins. These points should be added to the SWOT analysis: under “Strengths,” include technology utilization (AI) and how it yields better decision-making; under “Opportunities,” include being a local pioneer in AI-driven real estate to attract partnerships or exclusive deal flow. 3. Operations & Team Structure: With AI tools doing much of the heavy lifting in analysis and operations, our human resources can be structured more efficiently. The business plan should incorporate a role for a Technology Lead or Data Analyst (even if part-time or outsourced) who will maintain the AI systems and ensure data quality. This could be an update to the “Team Responsibilities” section (e.g., assign someone to manage the development of the AI assistant, or to oversee data integration) since in the original plan roles were “To be assigned”
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. We might also revise our hiring plan: instead of immediately hiring more analysts or admin staff as we scale, we might invest in technical expertise or training existing members on AI tools. This keeps the team lean while scaling output. It also means we allocate budget differently – e.g., a line item for AI software/subscriptions or consulting, balanced by possibly lower personnel costs in analysis/marketing. 4. Financial Projections: Incorporating AI can affect our financial model. Initially, there will be upfront costs (development of the website and AI assistant, software subscriptions, etc.), which should be reflected as investments in the startup costs and Year 1 expenses. However, over time, the efficiency gains should improve our profitability. For instance, if AI helps us flip houses faster or avoid bad deals, our return on investment could improve. We might project slightly better margins or shorter project timelines in the pro forma. Additionally, if the AI enables us to do more projects in parallel (since analysis is not a bottleneck), revenue growth could accelerate in years 2-3. We should update the projections to show a scenario where, by year 3, we handle maybe 20% more projects than we originally thought, due to AI-enabled productivity. It’s important to be somewhat conservative and not over-promise, but highlighting this potential will look favorable to investors. We can cite industry expectations: for example, generative AI and advanced analytics could significantly boost productivity; McKinsey notes real estate operations can become more efficient and open up new revenue streams with AI
mckinsey.com
. We can incorporate a modest efficiency gain in our forecasts (say operations cost as a percentage of revenue decreases over time thanks to automation). 5. New Services or Revenue Streams: An AI-enabled Framework Detroit might develop new offerings. For example, the AI property analysis tool we build for internal use could eventually be offered as a service to other investors or to government programs (e.g. helping Detroit Land Bank evaluate properties at scale). If we see this potential, we could add a note in the long-term vision about a tech product spin-off or licensing our proprietary algorithm. Similarly, our improved marketing and analysis capabilities could allow us to partner with more investors (maybe managing an investor fund was a 3-5 year vision
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
; AI could help manage that fund’s assets more effectively, making that vision more attainable sooner). We should update the “Long-Term Vision” section to include being a leader in tech-driven community redevelopment and perhaps developing a platform that could serve others (this aligns with possibly launching an investor fund – we could manage more capital if our systems allow us to find and manage deals efficiently). 6. Risk Mitigation and Management: The business plan should acknowledge new risks introduced by relying on technology. We should add a section in the risk analysis about technology risk – e.g., model errors or data breaches. For instance, if our AI valuation model is wrong, it could lead to a bad purchase. To mitigate, we state that all AI-generated outputs will be reviewed by experienced team members (AI augments, not replaces, human judgement – as Luxury Presence noted, AI can’t replace the human touch in real estate
luxurypresence.com
). We also commit to keeping data secure and following best practices (especially if we gather data via the WhatsApp assistant, ensure it’s stored safely). By highlighting these, we show that we are aware and prepared to manage tech-related risks. 7. Branding & Marketing Narrative: Our story to investors and stakeholders now includes innovation. We should update our pitch and marketing materials to tout our AI approach – e.g., “Framework Detroit combines real estate savvy with cutting-edge AI analysis to maximize returns and community impact.” This can be woven into the mission statement or executive summary of the plan. We balance it with our community focus: perhaps something like “By using advanced technology to make data-driven decisions, we aim to direct capital efficiently to the Detroit properties that need it most, aligning investor returns with community revitalization.” This way, AI is presented as a tool that furthers our purpose (not as a gimmick). In marketing channels, sharing the fact that we use an AI-driven process can also attract interest (it’s newsworthy/novel in local real estate). We can even write blog posts about how we use AI in our work, establishing thought leadership. In summary, the incorporation of AI and an AI assistant requires revisions throughout the business plan – from strategy and operations to financials and marketing. These updates emphasize that Framework Detroit is innovating in a space ripe for disruption, which can impress investors (showing we strive for efficiency and higher returns) and reassure partners that we intend to stay ahead of the curve. The core mission of community revitalization stays the same, but our methods get an upgrade. This alignment of purpose and innovation is a central theme of the updated plan.
AI Personal Assistant (WhatsApp-Based) – Plan & Requirements
One of the most impactful initiatives is the creation of an AI-powered personal assistant chatbot, accessible via WhatsApp, to assist the team with property analysis. This tool will function as a deal analyst that fits in your pocket – by simply texting an address, team members (or potentially anyone we authorize) can receive a comprehensive analysis of a property within minutes. Below is a detailed plan for this AI assistant, including functionality, technical architecture, data sources, and improvements. Use Case & User Flow:
Query via WhatsApp: A user (initially, Framework Detroit team members or partners) sends a WhatsApp message to the company’s designated number with a property address (e.g., "123 Main St, Detroit"). We will set up a WhatsApp Business API or integrate via a service like Twilio to programmatically handle incoming messages.
Data Retrieval: Upon receiving an address, the assistant’s backend service triggers data collection routines:
Zillow Data: The system will query Zillow (or an alternative real estate data API) for information on the property. This includes current Zestimate or list price, property details (beds, baths, square footage, year built, lot size), and importantly the photos if available. Zillow’s platforms have millions of photos and even provide an AI-driven Zestimate that weighs visual features
geekwire.com
contempothemes.com
. We can leverage Zillow’s API for property details (Zillow has an API for home valuation and property data) – if direct API access is limited, we may use a third-party aggregator like RapidAPI or simply scrape the needed info (respecting terms of service). The photos URLs can often be extracted; these will be fed into our computer vision module.
Detroit Parcel Data: Next, the assistant will fetch public data about the property. Detroit has open parcel data (ownership info, lot dimensions, tax assessments) and possibly data on code violations or Detroit Land Bank status. By integrating with Detroit’s open data portal or GIS API, the assistant can pull info such as last sale date/price, property tax valuation, and whether the property is government-owned or privately owned. This adds context (e.g., if it’s Land Bank-owned, the acquisition process differs; if taxes are delinquent, that’s noteworthy).
Comparable Sales and Market Data: The assistant will also gather comps – recent sales of similar homes nearby – either through Zillow (they often list comps) or by querying a service like Redfin’s API or MLS data if accessible. This will help in valuation and exit strategy. Additionally, neighborhood data like average rent, crime rate, or school ratings could be included if readily available via APIs; these factors might influence strategy (for instance, a high-rent area might favor a hold and rent exit).
Analysis & Algorithmic Processing: Once data is collected, the assistant runs its proprietary algorithm to analyze the investment:
Property Condition via Photos: Using computer vision (CV), the assistant inspects each available photo of the property. It will be trained to detect visible issues and features. For example, it might recognize a damaged roof, old HVAC units, mold or water stains, outdated kitchen/bath finishes, etc. We can utilize a pre-trained model (like a TensorFlow or PyTorch model trained on housing images) and fine-tune it with known examples. Notably, Zillow itself uses neural networks to assess curb appeal and interior quality from photos
contempothemes.com
, and tools like Restb.ai offer property image recognition that can tag conditions and even predict valuation impact
contempothemes.com
contempothemes.com
. Our system can incorporate such technology – either via an API from a provider like Restb.ai or an open-source model – to get a structured assessment of condition. For example, the output might be: “Roof: poor (visible missing shingles), Kitchen: outdated (20+ years old cabinets), Windows: new, Paint: needs redo, etc.” Each item could be rated or flagged.
Automated Scope of Work: Based on the detected issues, the assistant generates a draft Scope of Work – essentially a checklist of recommended renovations. This could be rule-based initially (e.g., if roof poor => “Replace roof shingles”; if kitchen outdated => “Kitchen remodel (new cabinets, appliances)”), with generic descriptions. Revive’s AI similarly produces a “renovation game plan with total budget and ROI gain” for agents in seconds
wavgroup.com
wavgroup.com
, which validates our approach. Our system will also cross-reference standard cost assumptions for each task to estimate costs. For example, roof replacement: $X per sq ft, kitchen remodel: $Y per sq ft, etc. We can use national averages adjusted for Detroit or input our own cost data. The result: a list of tasks with cost estimates and perhaps a timeframe estimate for each.
Financial Pro Forma: With the scope and costs, plus the acquisition price (from Zillow or assumed), the assistant creates a basic pro forma financial projection. This should include: purchase price + closing costs, renovation costs, holding costs (like 6 months of taxes, insurance, financing interest if any), and then either resale value (ARV) if flip or rental income if hold. The output would be key metrics like projected profit if flipped, ROI (return on cost), estimated ARV vs investment, or if a rental scenario, cap rate and cash-on-cash return. It will also incorporate our deal-approval metrics: for instance, highlight if Return on Cost >30% (pass) or not (fail)
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
. The comparables fetched can be used to estimate ARV (e.g., average $/sqft of nearby renovated sales times our sq footage). If the property as-is price is known, we compare our total cost to ARV to ensure target profit. Essentially, this step gives a go/no-go indication: is this deal likely profitable under various strategies?
Strategy Recommendation: Using the above analysis, the assistant formulates a purchase and exit strategy recommendation. For example: “Suggested acquisition strategy: Offer up to $50,000 (given needed repairs) and use a hard money loan at 8% (Kiavi/Roc360) if available, to leverage capital. Recommended exit: Fix-and-flip with a 5-month rehab, projected ARV $100,000, yielding ~20% net margin. Alternatively, as a rental, the property could rent for ~$1,000/mo, giving a 1.0% rent-to-value ratio, which meets our 0.9% threshold
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
, so holding is viable if financing at <=6% interest.” The recommendation algorithm will consider factors like: does it meet flip ROI criteria? If not, would it meet rental yield criteria? How is the neighborhood trend (if rising, maybe hold for appreciation)? It will be somewhat rule-based combined with any predictive model we develop for market trends. Over time, as we get data on our deals, we can refine these recommendations using machine learning (perhaps even train a classifier on deals we did vs passed on and their outcomes).
Formatting the Report: The data and insights are compiled into a report. This can be a PDF document or a web-based report (for ease, maybe a web page behind a short link). The report will include: Property summary (bed/bath, location, Zillow info), condition findings (perhaps with small thumbnails of photos and notes like “see water damage in photo”), the scope of work with cost estimates, the pro forma table, and the recommended strategy with key justifications. We will brand the report with Framework Detroit’s logo and maybe a disclaimer (AI-generated preliminary analysis, not a formal appraisal, etc.). A clear layout will help users quickly grasp the opportunity.
Delivery: The assistant then responds to the WhatsApp query with a short message summarizing results and a link to the full report. E.g., “FrameworkAI: 123 Main St – Estimated ARV $100k, Rehab $30k, Potential Profit ~$15k. Recommended: Flip. Details: [report link]”. The link could be a secure web link (maybe to our website domain, e.g., a hidden page or a PDF file in cloud storage). Using a link keeps the WhatsApp message concise and avoids huge text walls. If the user prefers, we could also allow a command like "summary" to get just a text summary in chat, and "full report" for the link.
Technical Architecture:
Frontend/Interface: WhatsApp is the UI. We will use the WhatsApp Business API (or Twilio’s WhatsApp sandbox during development) to connect. Essentially, WhatsApp messages will be received by a webhook in our system. No separate mobile app or UI is needed for now, which lowers friction – everyone is familiar with texting. For admin control, we might later build a simple web dashboard to see queries made, view reports, or re-run analysis, but that’s optional.
Backend Engine: This will be a server (cloud-hosted, e.g., on AWS Lambda or a small EC2 server, or a Heroku/DigitalOcean app) running the logic. It needs the following components:
Messaging handler: code to parse incoming messages (likely in Python or Node.js, as both have libraries for WhatsApp API). It will extract the address text.
Data fetcher: modules or services to call external APIs (Zillow, etc.). Zillow API may require OAuth or keys, we’ll set those up. For city data, possibly an API key for Detroit Open Data. Each of these calls returns JSON data that we then parse. (We should build in some error handling: if an address is not found or Zillow has no data, the assistant should respond with an apology or request clarification.)
Computer Vision module: possibly a separate service (for heavy processing). If using a cloud AI service (like Google Vision or a specialized real estate CV API), we’d send photos and get labels back. Alternatively, run an on-server model – which might require a GPU depending on model size. Since speed is a factor (we want results in perhaps 1-2 minutes), using a pre-trained API might be simplest initially. For instance, Restb.ai offers an API that can return property condition tags
contempothemes.com
. That could fast-track development. We’ll weigh the costs of using an API vs. building our own model. Early on, an API with per-use fees might be fine given low volume; long-term, training our own model (with sufficient data) could be more cost-effective and customizable.
Analysis & business logic: The core algorithm, which can be implemented in Python (using Pandas for number crunching, etc.). This will take the fetched data and CV results as inputs and apply our formulas/rules. We might code the financial model logic here explicitly (e.g., profit = ARV - purchasePrice - rehabCost - holdingCost). We’ll incorporate the criteria from our business plan (like the thresholds for ROI, etc.) into these calculations. Part of this logic could also involve calling a generative AI (like GPT) to produce the narrative of the recommendation, to make the output more readable. For example, after calculating everything, we could prompt an LLM with something like: “Summarize the investment opportunity for {address} given the following data... and make a recommendation.” This could yield a nicely worded few paragraphs which we can include in the report. OpenAI’s APIs or similar could handle that, albeit with careful prompt design to keep it factual and concise.
Database: We will maintain a log of queries and results. A simple database (SQL or even a Google Sheet/Airtable via API) can suffice initially. We want to store: the address queried, date, raw data pulled, the generated analysis (scope items and estimates), and the final report link. This database becomes a knowledge base of evaluated properties. Team members can search it later (“Did we analyze this one before?”). It also provides training data – we can add a column later like "Deal pursued? Y/N and outcome" to measure how the AI’s recommendations fared. All data should be timestamped and perhaps include who queried (if multi-user).
Report generator: To create the PDF or webpage. One approach is to use a PDF generation library (like ReportLab in Python or an HTML-to-PDF service) to compile the text and images into a nicely formatted PDF. Alternatively, host an HTML report: since we already have a website, we could create a template and fill it with data, then host it at a unique URL (like frameworkdetroit.com/reports/123MainSt-<date>). The advantage of HTML is interactive elements or easier viewing on mobile (PDFs on WhatsApp might force download). However, PDF is more shareable as a fixed document. We might implement both: send the link which opens a web page with the analysis, and have a button to download PDF. The report will include our branding and a disclaimer (perhaps “For internal use – AI-generated analysis, subject to verification”).
Security & Access: Initially, we will restrict usage to our team (maybe by checking the sender’s phone number against an authorized list). We don’t want random people using it and certainly not relying on it without context. As it matures, we could consider inviting select partners or even beta-testing with investor friends, but with caution. Data pulled from APIs should be handled per their terms of use (especially Zillow, which might limit commercial usage of their data – we’d aim to keep it in-house). Also, we should secure the backend endpoints (use API keys, HTTPS) because the system will have access to sensitive data and expensive API calls.
Performance Considerations: Each query triggers multiple network calls and computations. We expect a response time maybe on the order of 30 seconds to 2 minutes for full analysis (depends on image count and API speeds). That’s acceptable for now (we can have the bot send a “Working on it...” message if needed). We will design the system to handle one query at a time initially, which is fine with a small team. If we later scale it or have overlapping queries, we might need to queue tasks or increase computing resources. Using cloud functions or containers, we can scale out if needed.
Development Plan & Costs:
Building this AI assistant is a significant project, likely the most technically complex part of our plan. We will approach it in stages:
Phase 1 – MVP (Minimal Viable Product): Focus on the core outcome – given an address, get basic data and return a simple analysis (value and maybe a simple yes/no on deal viability). In the MVP, we might skip advanced image analysis and instead use simpler heuristics: e.g., just use Zillow’s data (like Zestimate vs listing price, year built as proxy for condition) and output a rough recommendation. This could be done relatively quickly (a few weeks of coding and testing) and gives us a working prototype to demonstrate the concept. We’ll use MVP to gather feedback and ensure the WhatsApp workflow is convenient.
Phase 2 – Incorporate Computer Vision & Detailed Scope: Once MVP is stable, integrate the photo analysis for granular rehab planning. This involves either integrating a third-party CV API (fastest route) or training a model (longer route). Given time constraints, using an existing AI service (like the Revive AI approach or Restb.ai) is sensible. We will budget for API usage costs here – often these services charge per image or per analysis. For example, if it’s a few cents per image, analyzing say 20 photos might cost $1 per property, which is reasonable for internal use. We should budget a few hundred dollars for initial testing and usage. If volume grows, we revisit the cost structure (maybe negotiate enterprise rates or switch to our own model).
Phase 3 – Expansion and Refinement: Add more data sources (rental data, neighborhood stats), refine cost estimates with our project data, and incorporate user feedback. Perhaps add the ability to adjust assumptions via chat (e.g., user can text "assume ARV 110k" or "what if rent is 1200?" and the assistant recalculates – a conversational aspect). Also consider adding conversational Q&A – after the report, the user could ask follow-ups like "Why flip instead of rent?" or "Show me the comps used," and an AI (likely an LLM) could answer based on the report data. This turns the tool into more of an interactive analyst, not just a static report generator.
Phase 4 – User Expansion & Frontend: If we see value, we might let external parties use a limited version. For example, maybe our investors could query an address of a property they are considering investing in with us. Or a website visitor could get a simple “enter address for an instant quote” (this enters territory of becoming a product in itself). For now, Phase 4 is optional and beyond the current scope, but we keep it in mind.
In terms of development effort, if done in-house by a team member with coding experience, this could take 2-3 months for a solid V1 (including learning curve on WhatsApp API, integrating various data sources, testing CV outputs, etc.). If we outsource to a developer or firm, costs could vary widely. A high-end estimate for a custom AI-driven app like this could be in the tens of thousands of dollars (some sources cite $100k+ for sophisticated real estate AI platforms)
biz4group.com
biz4group.com
. However, by starting with an MVP and using pre-built components, we can likely keep the initial version in the lower range. We’ll aim to keep development lean by using existing APIs and open-source libraries. Additionally, focusing on essential features first (MVP) is a known cost-saving approach in AI development
biz4group.com
, helping us deliver value early without overspending on nice-to-have features. Potential Challenges:
Data accuracy: The assistant’s outputs are only as good as the data and models. Zillow’s estimates or our CV might sometimes be off. We’ll need to routinely sanity-check the results, especially early on. For instance, if the AI suggests an ARV too high, we catch it and recalibrate. Over-reliance without verification is dangerous. So our roll-out plan internally will be to use the assistant as a guide, but still double-check critical numbers before making big decisions.
API limits and changes: Zillow or others could rate-limit or change access. We should have backup plans (like an alternative data source or a way to quickly update the integration). Maybe diversify data sources (use multiple listing sites or a paid data provider like ATTOM if necessary in future).
WhatsApp message formatting: We have to ensure the messages and links come through clearly. WhatsApp has message templates for business accounts; we will comply with their policies (like needing user opt-in, etc.). We might start testing in a sandbox environment and then apply for a WhatsApp Business number.
User adoption: Even within the team, adopting a new tool can have a learning curve. We will provide a simple one-page guide on how to use the assistant and what commands are available. After a few uses, it should become second nature to just message our AI for quick analysis.
Impact and Benefits:
Once running, this assistant could save substantial time in our acquisition process. What might take hours of an analyst’s work (pulling comps, calling contractors for rough bids, calculating returns) will be delivered almost instantly. This speed means we can put in offers faster and with more confidence. It also standardizes our analysis – every property is evaluated with the same framework, reducing oversight. Moreover, it creates a data repository of all analyses, which is invaluable for learning (we can look back and see why we decided something and how it turned out). The tool also impresses others; showing a lender or partner an AI-driven report could boost our credibility as a savvy operation. In essence, this AI assistant will serve as a tireless junior analyst that works 24/7. It won’t replace human decisions, but it will ensure we have robust data at our fingertips for each decision. And as mentioned, similar innovations are already proving effective: Revive’s Vision AI gives agents renovation plans in seconds
wavgroup.com
, and Zillow’s AI-driven analytics have improved valuation accuracy significantly
contempothemes.com
. We are bringing those cutting-edge capabilities in-house, tailored to our specific investment strategy in Detroit. Example Scenario:
To illustrate, suppose a wholesaler texts us about a new off-market deal on a Saturday. Instead of waiting until Monday to do research, we (or even the wholesaler, if we allow) text the address to our WhatsApp assistant. Within a minute, we receive: “3-bed/1-bath, 1500 sqft built 1940. Est. value $120k if renovated (~$80/sqft). Needs ~$30k work (roof, paint, kitchen update). Flip profit ~$20k or 22% ROI at $60k purchase. Rental est. $1,200/mo (1.0% RV). Recommendation: pursue purchase up to $65k; flip for resale at ~$120k; meets criteria (ROI >30% on cost including financing). Report: [link].” We quickly glance – it meets our ROI target and the scope seems manageable. We decide to schedule a viewing immediately and possibly secure the contract before others. All thanks to our AI speeding up the analysis. That’s the power we aim to harness.
Additional Improvements & Future Considerations
In developing these plans, we identified several areas for future improvement to ensure longevity and maximum impact of our initiatives. As a concluding section, we outline some recommendations and ideas beyond the current scope that could further improve Framework Detroit’s tech integration:
Continuous AI Learning: Build a feedback loop for the AI assistant. After each project, feed the actual outcomes (actual renovation cost, actual sale price or rent, actual timeline) back into the system. This can refine the algorithm’s predictions over time (a form of machine learning model updating). Essentially, the more we use it, the smarter it gets. We should document discrepancies (e.g., if AI estimated rehab $30k but it ended up $40k, why? What was missed?) and adjust the model or add new rules to cover those cases.
Expanding Data Sources: To improve accuracy, integrate more data. For example, incorporate MLS data through a partnership or service – that could give more detailed comps and maybe more photos. Use economic indicators like interest rates or local employment trends in the analysis for exit strategy (e.g., if interest rates spike, maybe flipping strategy adjusts or holding period changes). Pull in rental market data from sources like Rentometer or Zillow Rent Index to better evaluate buy-and-hold scenarios. The richer the data, the better the insight (though be mindful of overloading the user with too much info; keep the report focused).
User Interface Enhancements: While WhatsApp is convenient, in the future we might also want a web or mobile app interface for the assistant. A dashboard where one can input an address (or multiple addresses in bulk) and get analyses could be useful, especially if the team grows or if we use it in an office setting. This could also allow fine-tuning parameters (like adjusting the rehab budget or desired profit margin on the fly). A web UI could integrate maps (e.g., showing where comps are on a map) for richer context that’s not possible in a WhatsApp text.
Collaboration & Sharing: Extend the tools to collaborate with partners. For instance, if we work with certain investors, we could share a subset of the AI’s report with them to keep them informed or to jointly evaluate deals. We could have a feature to generate a “clean” version of the report (without our internal thresholds perhaps) to share externally. This transparency can build trust with investors or lenders (showing the thorough analysis backing each deal).
Integration with Pipeline Management: As we adopt tools like Notion or any CRM to track our deal pipeline (one of the next steps
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
), we should integrate the AI outputs into that workflow. For example, the assistant could automatically create a new entry in a Google Sheet or Notion database for each address analyzed, populated with key fields (price, est. ARV, etc.). This avoids duplicate data entry and ensures our pipeline tracker is always up to date with the latest analysis.
AI for Property Management (Longer-term): Once we start holding properties (rentals) significantly, we can use AI to assist in property management too. Chatbots for tenant inquiries, AI scheduling for maintenance (predicting when a furnace might fail based on age and use patterns), or even dynamic pricing for rents similar to how hotels/airlines do (if we have multiple units). This isn’t immediate, but planning for it aligns with possibly getting into multi-family or larger portfolios as mentioned in the vision (e.g., “20+ doors” goal
file-3s3mdwmz276ww1dt3cjycu
).
Community and Ethical Considerations: Since our mission involves community development, we should consider using AI ethically and in ways that benefit the community. For example, we could share some of our neighborhood analysis insights with city planners or community organizations to support broader revitalization efforts. Also, ensure our AI doesn’t inadvertently perpetuate biases (like undervaluing certain neighborhoods due to historical data that reflects redlining etc.). We might have to consciously adjust or override purely data-driven outputs to align with our purpose-driven mission. This could be an improvement where we program the AI to align with our values (e.g., maybe include a “community impact score” in our evaluations if data available, so we favor projects that also remove blight or provide affordable housing, not just the highest profit).
Marketing the AI Capability: Once proven internally, our AI-driven approach can itself be a marketing point. We can publish a case study on our blog about how using the AI assistant enabled us to, say, complete X deals in record time or avoid a bad deal that looked good on surface. This positions us as innovators and can attract media attention or investor interest. Essentially, turn our internal tool into part of our brand story (“tech meets real estate in Detroit”). We must, however, be careful not to give away any proprietary secret sauce if we consider it a competitive advantage.
Cost Management: Continuously monitor the cost of these tech initiatives. AI APIs, hosting, development – they add operational costs. But as long as the ROI (either through cost savings or increased profits) is positive, it’s justified. We should track metrics like how much time the AI saves (hours of analysis avoided) and how that translates to money (if we would have had to hire an analyst otherwise, etc.). Also track if AI-led decisions perform better or if deals found via AI yield higher returns. This helps prove the value of the investment in tech.
Staying Updated: The AI field is rapidly evolving. New models, APIs, and techniques emerge yearly. We should allocate time to stay updated (reading industry news, maybe attending proptech meetups or conferences). For instance, if a new AI service comes that can predict house prices even more accurately or some startup offers an API for rehab cost estimation specifically, we might integrate that instead of reinventing the wheel. Being flexible and modular in our implementation will allow swapping in better components as they come. It may even be worthwhile in the future to partner with a tech company or join a pilot program for real estate AI to get early access to new tools.
Finally, as a summary of impact, these improvements and the overall plan aim to make Framework Detroit a data-driven, efficient, and innovative real estate enterprise. By having a strong online presence and leveraging AI at multiple touchpoints, the company is positioned to punch above its weight – doing more with a small team, making informed decisions quickly, and appealing to stakeholders who value both profit and progress. We will revisit this PRD regularly as we implement features, checking off accomplishments (like the website launch, the first successful AI-assisted deal analysis) and updating it as new features or needs arise. This is a living roadmap guiding Framework Detroit’s next steps in combining real estate acumen with technological prowess, driving us closer to our vision of 20+ revitalized properties and a rejuvenated Detroit community.
