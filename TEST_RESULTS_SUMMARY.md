   - Property matching for manual events: ❌ NOT WORKING
   - Issue: Properties don't populate when using manual timeline (only works with AI-generated strategies)

## Playwright E2E Tests

- **Status**: ❌ Failed (20/20 tests failed)
- **Issue**: Tests are configured for `localhost:8080` but no local server is running
- **Solution**: Tests need to be updated to use live site URL or run with local development server

## Key Findings

### Working Features
1. ✅ AI strategy generation
2. ✅ Property matching (when using AI-generated strategies)
3. ✅ Zillow link integration
4. ✅ Mobile responsiveness
5. ✅ Save/Load/Export functionality
6. ✅ Timeline table operations

### Issues Identified
1. ❌ Property matching doesn't work with manually added timeline events
2. ❌ Playwright tests need configuration update for live site testing
3. ⚠️ Net Worth chart visualization not rendering (canvas element missing)

## Test Coverage

- **Standalone Scripts**: 14 test scripts created and organized
- **E2E Tests**: 70+ Playwright tests available (need configuration)
- **Test Suites**: 3 organized suites created (Core, Property, UI)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Manual Property Matching**: Investigate why "Find Actual Listings" only works with AI-generated timelines
2. **Update Playwright Config**: Add configuration for live site testing
3. **Implement Chart Visualization**: Add missing Net Worth chart functionality
4. **Create Local Dev Setup**: Document how to run tests locally

## Overall Status

The core functionality is working well on the live site, with property matching successfully integrating with Zillow when using AI-generated strategies. The main issue is that manual timeline events don't trigger proper property matching, which should be addressed in the next development phase.
